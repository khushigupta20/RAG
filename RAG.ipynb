Building on the \\nmomentum of the 2004 Hilton Head conference, the 2006 conference has expanded significantly.  \\nWe are pleased to have CIB joining us as an  official sponsor in addition to our ASCE \\nsponsorship.  The global focus of this year’s c onference is truly represented by delegates from \\nEurope, Asia, Africa, North and South America.  We are looking forward to great presentations, \\nopportunities for discussion both formal in the c onference and informal during afternoons on the \\nbeach.  Our conference format is once agai n focused on providing maximum presentation, \\ndiscussion, and interaction time.

The Committee on Academic Prerequisite s for Professional Practice (CAP^3) has been \\nworking to implement the policy for the past four years. The purpose of this  paper is to describe \\nthe progress over the last year a nd the next steps for the implem entation of Policy Statement 465.  \\n \\nIntroduction  \\n \\nIn October 2001, the American Society of Ci vil Engineers (ASCE) Board of Direction \\nunanimously approved Policy Statement 465, entitle d “Academic Prerequisites for Licensure and \\nProfessional Practice.” In October 2004, the policy was unanimously revised. This policy \\nsupports “the attainment of the Body of Knowledg e (BOK) for the entry into  the practice of civil \\nengineering at the professional level.” Under girding this policy is the belief that the BOK \\nnecessary to enter the pract ice of civil engineering at the professional level in the future will be \\nbeyond the scope of a traditional 4-year bachelo r’s degree and required practical experience. \\nWhile ASCE recognizes that implementation of  Policy Statement 465 will not occur overnight, \\nthis policy has the potential to  transform the practice of ci vil engineering, and positively \\ninfluence the safety, quality, efficiency, and sust ainability of the built environment in the 21st \\nCentury. The purpose of this paper is to describe  the progress over the la st year and the next \\nsteps for the implementation of Policy Statement 465.   \\nBackground  \\n \\nThe last four years have seen major progress in  ASCE’s “Raise the Bar” initiative, from the \\ncreation of a Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (BOK), to a sea change in the reaction \\ntowards this initiative. The CAP ^3 Body of Knowledge committee formulated and published the \\nfirst edition of the Civil Engi neering Body of Knowledge for the 21st Century in early 2004. \\nThis effort moved the focus of ASCE’s initiativ e from one principally referencing degrees to a ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The overarching goal of CAP^3 is to develop, orga nize, and implement ASCE’s “Raise the Bar” \\ninitiative. To accomplish this multi-phased objective, CAP^3 has spread its efforts over several fronts including curricula, accreditation, licen sure, and BOK fulfillment and validation, and \\nlevels of achievement. Efforts in each of thes e five fronts were carried out by a constituent \\ncommittee.   There were 9 face-to-face meetings and 93 c onference calls during Fiscal Year 2005. Through \\nthese engagements, the overall efforts and accomplishments of the five committees in Fiscal Year 2005 were as follows:   The Curricula Design Committee  has been working in earnest for the past two years. The \\nCurriculum Committee is evaluating the BOK, mapping the BOK against the curricula of 25 \\nparticipating undergraduate programs, and maki ng suggestions on inconsistencies and how to \\nimprove the BOK. The Curriculum Committee re gularly corresponds with a wide group of \\nstakeholders, and is leading the charge to  engage CEE faculty and administrators.  \\n The Accreditation Committee  has been formulating revised ci vil engineering program criteria, \\nin concert with the ASCE accreditation comm unity, for submission to the Engineering \\nAccreditation Commission of  ABET, Inc. The goal of this en deavor is to incorporate primary \\nelements of the BOK into civil engineering cu rricula via the basic le vel civil engineering \\nprogram criteria and the advanced level general criteria. In general,  flexibility is being sought to \\nallow universities to efficiently obtain accr editation of both undergraduate and graduate \\nprograms of the same engineering discipline. Su ch flexibility does not exist within current \\ninterpretations of ABET policies.  \\n The Licensure Committee  has continued to provide input to CAP^3 and to each of its \\ncommittees from a licensure perspective. The Licensure Committee has closely monitored the \\nactivities of National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Survey ing (NCEES) regarding \\nproposed modifications to the Model Law. Add itionally, the Licensure Committee continues to \\nseek and identify states that may wish to consid er early implementation of additional engineering \\neducation requirements as a pr erequisite for licensure.  \\n The BOK Fulfillment and Validation Committee  began work in the fall of 2004 on two fronts. \\nThey explored concepts to allow alternative education providers othe r than universities to \\nprovide credible post-graduate engineering education. To become viable, such alternative \\neducation channels must be equivalent in acad emic rigor and individua l performance assessment \\nto upper level undergraduate and graduate level education at traditiona l universities. This \\ncommittee also addressed how to assure that th e requisite BOK is fulfilled through a combination \\nof a bachelor’s degree and approximately 30 cred its of courses in technical and professional \\npractice topics. The committee was “sunsetted” on May 1, 2005.   The Levels of Achievement Committee  was formed as a result of input from the Curricula \\nDesign committee.

The committee completed their work in September 2005.   The Second Edition of the Body of Knowledge Committee  was formed at the end of 2005 to \\ndevelop the second edition of the ASCE BOK.  Since the publication of the original BOK \\ndocument in February 2004, there have been many papers written, talks presented and \\ndiscussions held on the BOK. The purpose of the new BOK-2 committee is to review all that has \\ntranspired and to update the BOK, as necessary to  reflect the new information. The expected date \\nof completion of this effort is February 2007.   The remainder of the paper will address at great er length the efforts and accomplishments of the \\ncurricula design committee, the accreditation committee, and the levels of achievement \\ncommittee.   \\nCurricula Design Committee  \\n \\nThe Curricula Design Committee has been working in earnest for the past year. The Curriculum \\ncommittee’s primary activities have been eval uating the BOK, mapping the BOK against the \\ncurricula of 25 participating undergraduate programs, drafting curricula on paper that would \\nfulfill the BOK, and making suggestions on how to improve the BOK. The Curriculum Committee regularly corresponds with a wide group of  stakeholders and is leading the effort to \\nincorporate the BOK into the formal academic process (as applicable).  \\n \\nActivities and Accomplishments \\n \\n \\n• The committee conducted conference calls approx imately every two weeks for the past year. \\nThe third face-to-face meeting of the comm ittee was held on June 11, 2005 in Portland, \\nOregon.  \\n• The committee formed a group of correspondents comprised of civil engineers and others \\ninterested in ASCE Policy Statement 465 a nd civil engineering e ducation. This group \\nreviews draft materials, responds to questions , and otherwise provides ideas and information \\nfor consideration by the committee.  \\n• The committee has authored or co-authored articles and papers and made numerous \\npresentations about its activities  and progress for ASCE and ot her professional organizations \\nsuch as the American Society for Engineer ing Education (ASEE). Currently, the committee \\nis also compiling a bibliography of all publishe d articles and reports related to education \\nreform and “Raising the Bar.”  \\n• Currently, there are 25 universities that are asse ssing their curricula relative to the BOK. The \\ncommittee has worked to assess how much of th e BOK is covered in these 25 participating \\npartner schools. This task—called progr am mapping—began in November 2003 and is \\nexpected to be completed in December 2005. We stern Michigan University is actually \\nimplementing the BOK in its new undergraduat e Civil Engineering degree program, as well \\nas refocusing its graduate degree program.

With time, other curr iculum design partners \\nare expected to implement BOK-based programs.  \\n• The committee and its curricular design partne rs continue to review the outcomes and \\ncommentaries of the BOK. A related goal of this  endeavor is to determine the appropriate \\nlocation for the professional breadth outcomes (Outcomes 13, 14, and 15) in the curriculum \\nas well as how they can be taught. At this po int, it is assumed that Outcomes 13, 14, and 15 \\nwill be part of the undergraduate program.  \\n• Work is being done to identify potential f unding sources for BOK curricular development \\nand implementation; to inform interested CE de partment heads, chairs, and faculty of such \\nfunding; and to encourage these parties to apply. One possible funding source is the U.S. \\nDepartment of Education (DOE). The DOE solicits proposals annually. Although there are \\nno substantive actions to report, the committ ee remains in communication with the DOE.  \\n• The committee also established a subcommittee to  re-examine the attitude section presented \\nin the first edition of the BOK. The report is complete and will be forwarded to the Second \\nEdition of the Body of Knowledge Committee for their consideration in preparing the next \\nedition of the BOK.  \\n  \\nAccreditation Committee  \\n \\nThus far in 2005, the Accreditation Committee has drafted its primary work products, developed \\nconsensus for these documents within the civi l engineering accredita tion community, and has \\nbeen communicating and coordina ting with the Engineering Accr editation Commission (EAC) of \\nABET, Inc.   The Accreditation Committee, has drafted propose d revised ABET basic le vel civil engineering \\nprogram criteria to incorporat e the appropriate components of the BOK into the undergraduate \\ncivil engineering curr icula -- and incorporate Bloom’s ta xonomy into the description of \\nachievement levels. The Accreditation Committee has also been working with the EAC of ABET \\non modifications to the ABET advanced level genera l criteria, to provide assurance that holders \\nof an accredited master’s degree in civil engineer ing have satisfied the full civil engineering \\nbody of knowledge, and to facilita te the ABET accreditation of engineering master’s programs in \\nthe U.S. To allow the latter, flexibility is bei ng sought to allow universities to efficiently obtain \\naccreditation of both undergraduate and graduate pr ograms of the same engineering discipline. \\nSuch flexibility does not currently exist in e ngineering within current interpretations of ABET \\npolicies.

The outcome was very  positive and generated support \\nfor implementation of the draft criteria.  \\n• The committee met with the EAC Criteria Committee on July 13, 2005, and explained the \\ncommittee’s overall initiative and plans. The committee also provided crucial comment to the EAC on proposed Advanced Level General Crit eria, leading to the probable adoption of \\nmuch, but not all, of the committee’s suggested  language. Finally, the committee participated \\nin EAC discussions leading up to a decision by the EAC to openly evaluate lifting of the \\nprohibition against dual level accreditation.  \\n• The committee met with the DHCEC, CTC&A, and the CC&A on October 1, 2005 and \\nthoroughly briefed these key stakeholders  on its draft accred itation products.  \\n  \\nLevels of Achievement Committee  \\n \\nThe Body of Knowledge (BOK) is defined in ASCE Policy Statement 465 as “the necessary depth and breadth of knowledge, skills, and attitu des required of an individual entering the \\npractice of civil engineering at the professional level in the 21st  Century.” As noted earlier, the \\nfoundational role of the BOK in implementing ASCE PS 465 resulted in the 2004 publication by \\nASCE of the report Civil Engineering Body of  Knowledge for the 21st Century. The BOK is \\npresented in that  report in accordance with these three themes: 1) what should be taught to  and learned by future \\ncivil engineering students; 2) how should it be taught and learne d; and 3) who should teach and \\nlearn it. The Committee’s prim ary focus was the what.  \\n Implementation of ASCE PS 465 is a complex, l ong-term, and highly interdependent effort \\nillustrated, in part, by the number of involved stak eholders within and outside of ASCE. Many of \\nthese stakeholders reviewed and began to work with the BOK in carrying out their \\nresponsibilities. As a resu lt of reviewing and using the BOK report recommendations, \\nstakeholders identified a problem and raised issues related to the BOK.  \\n The problem revolved around the three principal words used to define competency levels, \\nnamely recognition, understanding, and ability. In particular, the CAP3 Curriculum Design \\nCommittee came to this conclusion: Until there were understandable and readily applicable \\ncompetency definitions—including definitions th at would be understood by those outside the \\ncommittee—evaluation of existing curricula and development of example curricula would be \\ndifficult if not impossible.  \\n \\nAccordingly, CAP3 formed the Levels of Ac hievement Subcommittee in February 2005 and \\ncharged it with resolving the levels of comp etency problem. The Subcommittee, including \\nmembers and corresponding members from academia and public and private practice, studied the \\nproblem.

The School of Construction was made possible by gifts from two alumni and \\ncommitments from the two Colleges, two Departments, and the University Provosts.     \\nIntroduction/ How Did We Get Here? \\n \\n The authors of this paper have worked together  for the past 20 years.  They first worked \\nto establish a program of Construction Engineer ing and Management (CEM) in the Department \\nof Civil and Environment Engineer ing (CEE).  That effort started in 1985 has lead to a nationally \\nrecognized CEM program with four full time f aculty. The task in CEM was to create a high \\nquality program within CEE curriculum that  provided a constructi on concentration for \\nundergraduate Civil Engineering students and fo rmed the basis for a high level research and \\ngraduate program.  This program currently ha s about 45 graduate stude nts and regularly outputs \\ncivil engineering undergraduate stud ents who take on roles in the construction industry.  Of the \\n150 or so CE graduates per year  about 33% go into construction. \\n  In 1995 the first author left the CEM program  to take on the Depart ment Head position in \\nBuilding Construction (BC).  His tasked was to solidify a floundering department, add a research \\nagenda, and increase the quality of a newl y formed graduate degree in Construction \\nManagement.  The department over the past 10 year s has increased its visi bility and quality as \\nwell as has grown from 85 students to 280 students; 45 of these are in the graduate program.   \\nIn fall of 2003 the authors began a discussion to explore the possibi lity of bringing the \\ntwo programs together and benefit from obviously av ailable but hard to achieve synergies.

The advisory board una nimously endorsed the idea and moved ahead to \\nfind a matching gift.  This result ed in a verbal commitment from another alumnus, John Lawson.    \\n The two donors were keynote speak ers at the April 05 at our C onstruction Awards Banquet, and \\nconfirmed their joint commitment to support the establishment of the Myers-Lawson School of \\nConstruction.   \\nA contribution was requested from the uni versity and a memorandum of understanding \\nbetween the University Presiden t, the Provost the Deans of Arch itecture and Urban Studies and \\nEngineering and the two department heads was agreed in March 2005.   \\nDuring summer of 05 a strategic planning initiative was undertaken and a formal \\nproposal for the establishment of a School of Co nstruction at Virginia Tech was developed for \\napproval through the University governance system.  Working sessions with faculty from BC \\nand CEM were undertaken to reach common vi sion and mission for the school and these, \\ntogether with the strategic plan were accepted by the newly constituted School of Construction \\nAdvisory Board. at their Fall 05 meeting.   \\nThe formal proposal for the establishment and naming of the Myers-Lawson School of \\nconstruction at Virginia Tech was approved by the University Board of Visitors on March 27th \\n2006. \\n \\nVision, Mission and Guiding Principles. \\n \\n It is difficult to underestimate the impor tance of establishing a common vision, mission \\nand set of guiding principles for a venture of this nature.  Ross Myers and John Lawson provided \\nthe framework during their keyno te address at the Construction Awards Banquet when they \\narticulated their vision in the following five areas: \\n1. The School must strive to be the best – it must set the standard for and take a \\nleadership role in construction educa tion and define a construction community. \\n2. The School must be student centric – it must focus on students, build their \\ncommitment to construction and improve thei r ability to lesad in all sectors of the \\nindustry. \\n3.

These are \\nlisted below: \\n \\n1. There must, in the first place, be wise, committed and dedicated executive leadership \\nfrom industry that is passionate about the ve nture, able to naviga te through differences \\nand maintain a course towa rds the final destination.  \\n2. There must be an acknowledgement of the contribution and equali ty of the different \\nentities entering into the relationshi p.  There cannot be feelings of \\nsuperiority/inferiority.  It must be an incl usive group that believes  in the value of each \\npartner.  This cannot be understated.  A re lationship/team cannot emerge without this \\nfirst requirement. \\n3. The parties must agree on the benefits and end results before they get into the details.  \\nIf the fundamental philosophy is not in place the details will always derail the process.   \\n4. This end result of a school of construction is not about engineer ing, architecture, or \\nbuilding construction.  It is a bout doing what is best for our students, our industry, and \\nour university.  It is about looking to crea te a construction community.\\n   \\n5. Joining must be voluntary.  Compulsory involvement will not work. \\n6. The leadership team must be accepting of a ll its children.  There mu st be a feeling of \\nownership of all degrees and types of gradua tes that will be invol ved in the school of \\nconstruction.   \\n7. There must be a commitment to success with the tact, tenacity and patience needed to \\nhear all points of view, find co mmon ground and move forward.

Industry involvement provides construction programs  with ideas and resour ces necessary to meet \\nthe challenge of continuously improving construction education.  This paper will discuss the \\nfindings of a survey among construction progra ms members of the Associated Schools of \\nConstruction (ASC). The purpose of the study wa s to learn about constr uction programs and to \\nidentify factors that could promote mutually be neficial relationships between the construction \\nindustry and construction education programs. The results of the survey showed that general \\ncontractors and commercial build ing contractors have a higher level of involvement with \\nconstruction programs. It was also found that internship programs and assistance in securing \\nfinancial resources were factors that could pr omote mutually beneficial industry-education \\npartnerships.  \\nIntroduction  \\nThe increasing complexity of today’s co nstruction industry re quires continuous \\nimprovement of construction education programs. An important factor that has shown to be \\nessential to the success of construction programs is the involvement of the construction industry \\n(Badger, 1999).

Construction facu lty must meet this challenge by keeping up with the changes \\nin the industry and incorporating these chan ges into the curriculum . Construction industry \\npractitioners can be involved in  construction education in many  capacities. They can provide \\nconstruction educators with ideas for topics to be  included in courses, they can help researchers \\nidentify industry problems that need to be solv ed, and they can give feedback to construction \\nprograms on how effective the program is in educating students to succeed in today’s \\nconstruction industry.   The goal of the survey discussed in this paper is to determine the level of involvement of \\nconstruction industry practitioners and the benefits to the programs  with which they are involved. \\nCharacteristics of the construc tion programs surveyed are pres ented and factors that could \\ncontribute to successful industry- education partnerships are disc ussed.

The ASC is an organization \\nestablished in 1965 which goal is to foster  excellence in constr uction communication, \\nscholarship, research, education, and practice. The membership of the ASC includes academic \\nprograms in disciplines such as architecture,  engineering, management, technology, and others. \\nThe ASC is organized into seven geographic regions  in the United States (Northeast, Southeast, \\nGreat Lakes, North Central, South Centra l, Rocky Mountain, and Far West) and two \\ninternational regions, one for international instit utions (Canada; Europe; Asia and the Pacific; \\nand Caribbean/Central/South America) and one fo r industry professionals (ASC Website, 2005). \\n The use of the survey questionnaire is intended to  provide results that ar e descriptive in nature \\nand are intended to prov ide an understanding of what factor s construction progr ams consider to \\npromote successful industry-educati on partnerships. The questions included in this survey were \\ndivided into three groups:  information about the programs, in formation about industry partners, \\nand factors that contribute to successful industry involvement. \\n The survey was sent to construction programs members of the ASC across the United States. \\nOne hundred and nine (109) construction related pr ograms were contacted from all regions of the \\nASC (ASC Website, 2005). The construction program s surveyed included programs that reside \\nin civil engineering schools as well as progr ams in technology schools and architecture schools. \\nA total of 19 programs from 5 regions of ASC completed the survey for a 17.4% response rate \\n(see Table 1).

The largest programs were located in Region VI of ASC. From the survey it was also learned that 58% of the programs surveyed had a graduate program. The \\nprograms with a larger proportion of graduate students, female students, and international \\nstudents were located in the Far West Region of  ASC. There were notable differences in the \\nsizes of the graduate programs. For example, Region II and the Far West Region had a combined \\n32% of the graduate programs but the Far We st Region had a much higher percentage of \\ngraduate students. This shows that graduate pr ograms in the Far West Region schools are larger. \\nThe data also shows that there are notable differe nces in the number of female and international \\nstudents.

Traditional classroom teaching was the most used  technique with an average rating of 9.3 and \\ndistance education was the least used with an average rating of 2. Case studies and field trips were moderately used with average ratings of  4.8 and 4.4 respectively.

This paper evaluated the \\nfactors that can result in su ccessful industry-educa tion partnerships. A survey was conducted \\namong construction programs members of the Associated Schools of Construction (ASC). \\nConstruction programs from five ASC regions responded to the survey (17.4% response rate). \\nImportant information was collected about the construction programs, the types of companies \\ninvolved with the programs, and the types of involvement they had with the programs.  \\n It was observed that faculty in the programs surv eyed dedicate on average close to 80% of their \\ntime to teaching activities. It is important to determine if this high percentage is due to \\ndepartmental goals or to issues with lack of  funding for construction research. This is an \\nimportant issue since research serves as a catalys t for the development of future faculty and the \\nimprovement process of construction programs. The data also showed that some of the regions \\nsurveyed had a significant number of adjunct facu lty. This may be an indication of two issues, \\nthe shortage of faculty and the need for facu lty with industry expe rience. The construction \\nindustry can have a significant role in addressi ng these issues by providing the opportunity for \\nfaculty to participate in internship programs that will enhance their practical knowledge.

It then  goes on to argue that the ability of international \\nconstruction majors (ICMs) to successfully manage their evolutionary path depends on: i) \\ncompetencies and core competencies they alread y possess, ii) managerial comprehension of the \\ncorporate objectives to be achieved, the necessary  competencies and core competencies to be \\ndeployed for the cause and where those can be obtained, iii) managerial entrepreneurial and \\nadministrative competence and, iv) the corporate infr astructure to facilitate managerial efforts \\nand effective mobility of competencies and core  competencies across the group. It is then \\nproposed that by conceptualizing ICMs as comp anies managing through th eir corporate center \\nportfolios of competencies existing at their cons tituent parts, rather than portfolios of market \\nfocused business streams (BSs), waste and duplication of resources when pursuing process and \\nscale specialization can be redu ced. The four focal points outlin ed above are brought forward as \\na framework that will allow researchers and practitioners a more realistic and holistic examination of the competence related evolutionary issues that ICMs face. \\n \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\nCertain companies are more successful at ma naging their evolutionary path than their \\npeers. The companies of primary concern to th is paper are large international construction \\norganizations, which we shall refer to as international construction majors (ICMs). Adopting the \\nnotion that while industry characteristics matter,  they are not as impo rtant as organizational \\ncharacteristics when accounting for prospects for growth (Wernerfelt, 1984; Schmalensee, 1985; \\nRumelt, 1991), the key challenge for any company becomes to preemptively build the capabilities, competencies and core competen cies that provide ga teways to tomorrow’s \\nopportunities, as well as to find nov el applications of current capa bilities, competen cies and core \\ncompetencies it possesses, by creating an organi zational environment that can facilitate their \\neffective mobility (Hamel and Prahalad, 1994;  Teece et al., 1997; Langford and Male, 2001).  \\n \\n \\nCapabilities, Competencies and Core Competencies \\n \\nFollowing Nelson and Winter (1982), Helfat et al. (2003: 999) de fined organizational \\ncapabilities as ‘ the ability of an organization to perform a coordinated set of tasks by utilizing ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Winter (2003) \\ndescribed operational capabilities  as those that permit a firm to make a living in the short term \\nand dynamic capabilities  as those that operate to exten d, modify or create operational \\ncapabilities . McGrath et al. ( 1995: 251) define competence  in operational terms as ‘ the degree to \\nwhich a firm or its sub-units reliably and consistently meet  or exceed objectives ’ and have shown \\nthat it is  positively associated with the level of co mprehension and deftness of the responsible \\nmanagerial group1. Hall, (1993) has further explained that organizational competencies  constitute \\nof the know-how of employees (as well as supplie rs, advisers and distributors) and the collective \\nattributes , which add up to organizational culture.  \\n The difference between capabilities  and competencies  is not obvious from the literature. \\nThe confusion is worsened by the fact that thos e terms are almost always preceded by different \\nadjectives ( dynamic,  functional, operational, organizational and core) and because of the fact \\nthat they are both based on the broader concept of organizational routin es that a company has \\ndeveloped throughout its history of operation. However, there is  a difference between the two \\nthat can be understood if we examine the words capability  and competence  through a number of \\nlenses. First, we see that the Oxford Dictionary defines the terms as follows:  \\n• Capability  as the power or ability to do something. \\n• Competence  as having the necessary ability or kn owledge to do something successfully.  \\n \\nSecond, we can observe that 'capabili ty' has as a constituent the word ability , whereas \\n'competence' the word petition , which, combined with com (meaning “comes with” in Latin) \\nsuggests that a competence  is something that comes through the intentional realization of a \\nprocess towards specific objectives. Theoreticall y, having set and then met corporate objectives, \\na company should have developed at all hierarch ical levels the human skills and organizational \\nprocesses supporting its competitive superiorit y in the range of services it offers\\n2.  \\nWe could argue that it is the competence with which organizati onal capabilities are \\nmanaged and deployed that distinguishes one competito r from the other. In the words of Helfat et \\nal (2003: 999): “ Simply because a capability may have reac hed a threshold level of reliability, \\ndoes not imply that the capability has attained the highest possible level of functionality. To say \\nthat an organization has a capability means onl y that it has reache d a minimum level of \\nfunctionality that permits repe ated, reliable performance of an activity. Some versions of \\ncapability are better than others” . \\n ICMs – or any diversified comp any for that matter – that ma nage through their corporate \\ncenter portfolios of capabilities an d competencies existing at their constituent parts, can develop  \\ncompetencies  at the core (or corporate center) of the organization that we will refer to as core \\ncompetencies , which can be applied to and support their competitiveness in a range of markets \\nthey are active in, while providing scope for further competence-related diversification (Wernerfelt, 1984; Hamel and Prahalad, 1990; 1994) . Core competencies re present the collective \\nlearning of the organization. When applied to  construction (Haan et  al., 2002) the core \\n                                                \\n \\n1Comprehension involves the processes by which management at all hierarchical levels develops a good \\nunderstanding of what combinations of resources will allow it to meet business objectives. Deftness involves creating working relationships which enable management to execute effectively in light of comprehension (McGrath \\net al., 1995:251).  \\n2In practice however, a company’s reali zed strategy is a function of its intended , deliberate  and emergent  strategy- \\nwhere patterns develop in the absence of intentions or in sp ite of them (Mintzberg et al ., 2003) and where objectives \\nmight change before they have been met.   \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We can thus \\nunderstand core competencies  for the purpose of this paper as  “the people skills and \\norganizational processes facilita ting them that have been d eveloped at the core of the \\norganization as a company specific set of stra tegic resources, supporting its competence to \\ncoordinate and manage ef ficiently, effectivel y and in a complement ary and supplementary \\nmanner the individual competencies  that exist at individual BSs and/or BUs  in order to obtain \\nor retain access to a wide variety of market s and make a significant contribution to perceived \\ncustomer benefits of the end pr oduct/service, with the ultimate purpose being the sustainability of \\nthe competitive superiority of the firm”. \\nIt becomes clear at this stage that what is of  key importance to the long term prosperity of \\nICMs is the full exploitation of  the potential the competenci es they offer, through their \\neffective deployment on a corporate wide basis,  as well as their competence in transforming \\ncapabilities to competencies a nd core competencies. Following  the line of argument above, \\nwhich derives from a review of strategi c management, evolutionary economics and \\nconstruction related literature, the authors belie ve that the ability of ICMs to successfully \\nmanage their evolutionary path depends upon a nd can be more realistically and holistically \\nexamined through a theoretical framework cons isting of the following four focal points:  \\n \\no The competencies and core competencies: that ICMs already possess. \\no Managerial comprehension: of the corporate objectives to  be achieved, the capabilities, \\ncompetencies and core competencies that need to be deployed for the cause and where those are to be obtained or how they can be developed. \\no Managerial entrepreneurial a nd administrative competence: to identify and push \\nforward business opportunities to which the company’s existing capabilities, competencies and core competencies are applic able and then to aggr egate those business \\nventures within the existing organizational framework. \\no The corporate infrastructure: that will efficiently facilitate managerial efforts in light \\nof comprehension and  will ensure effective mobility of  capabilities, competencies and \\ncore competencies across the organization, as well as clear communication of corporate \\nobjectives across BSs, their constituent BUs and throughout hier archical levels. \\n \\n \\nCompetencies, Core Competencies and “Com petence Management” in Construction \\n \\nTo understand competencies and core compet encies within a construction specific \\ncontext, let us present a hypot hetical example.

By deploying \\nentrepreneurial and administrative skills while slowly embedding to the organization efficient \\nprocesses facilitating their efforts, its founder( s) and employees made the company gradually \\ncompetent in performing value- adding activities such  as bidding, procurement, contract \\nmanagement, project management and on-site op erations. This enabled the company to grow \\nbased on its strengths and to be able to set dive rsification and internati onalization objectives for \\nthe near future. In time, GIGAS ltd diversified- in  related markets to those it was active in that \\nnevertheless had their market and local idiosync rasies – to form BUs Stella ltd, a commercial \\ndeveloper and Yiannis Ltd, a faci lities management company. It al so internationalized to form \\nAlex ltd, a general building cont ractor in a neighboring country.  Each of these BUs developed \\ngradually market specific competencies in a sim ilar process like the one initially described for \\nGIGAS ltd, less one fundamental difference: the new BUs were initiating their existence with \\nendowments of human skills and established orga nizational processes th at GIGAS ltd already \\npossessed and could deploy to their favor. \\nYears down the line the BUs gr ew to a size where the group’s operations had to be \\ngrouped under three market focused BSs. “S tella”, comprising comm ercial development \\ncompanies in a number of countries, “Yiannis”, providing facilities management services \\ninternationally and “Alex”, undertaking all construction operations. GIGAS, now a plc, \\ncontinued to monitor, control and coordinate th eir efforts from the corporate center. A more \\nelaborate corporate governance system had e volved and certain organizational aspects had \\nbecome of critical importance. Clear communica tion of corporate objectiv es and how those were \\nto be achieved was strongly pursued, to enable managers and decision makers to comprehend the \\nsphere of ultimate potential purposes of  any project that the company undertook3 (Artto and \\nDietrich, 2004). Efficient communication channels had been set up to enable feedback to take \\nplace and senior management to take decisions ba sed on timely and accurate information, so that \\nemergent strategies could be more successfully in tegrated with the group’s realized strategies. \\nManagerial entrepreneurial  and administrative  competencies (Penrose, 1988) were also nurtured \\nso that the human skills would exist for new in itiatives that could co ntribute to the group’s \\ngrowth and prosperity to be id entified and successfully pursued. \\n  Currently, each business stream (BS) possesse s a portfolio of competencies that underpin  \\nits  competitive  superiority  in  its  chosen  market.

By managing through the corporate \\ncenter portfolios of competencies  existing at its constituent pa rts, GIGAS plc has developed \\ncompetencies at its “core” (i.e. its corporate cente r) that we can refer to as its core competencies. \\nCore competencies have the dual nature of enab ling GIGAS plc to obtain or retain access to a \\nwide variety of markets and make  a significant contributi on to perceived customer benefits of the \\nend product/service. Figure 2 shows the portfolio of competencies that GIGAS plc as a whole is \\nin possession of, as well as th e portfolio of core competencies it has developed through \\nmonitoring, coordinating and controlling the efforts of its constituent parts. \\nAlliancing and intra-group collaboration are core competencies that GIGAS plc has \\ndeveloped through years of coordinating, controlli ng and supporting the efforts of its constituent \\nBUs that grew to become BSs and they too cons ist of a combination of  managerial skills and \\norganizational processes that facilitate manage rial efforts. Financi ng and Asset Management \\nmight not be deployed at a supra-divisional level but constitute core competencies for the organization since they fulfill both criteria of en abling it to obtain or retain access to a wide \\nvariety of markets (such as PFI and developm ent) and make a significant contribution to \\nperceived customer benefits of the end product/ service. The portfolio mapping shown on figures \\n1 and 2 could be extended to includ e capabilities, so that the pote ntial for their transformation to \\ncompetencies could be identified and examin ed further in a company specific context. \\n \\nDiscussion \\n \\n We  stated  in the introduction that th e key challenge for any company becomes to \\npreemptively  build  the  capabilities,  competen cies  and  core  competencies that provide \\ngateways  to  tomorrow’s  opportunities,  as well   as  to  find novel applications of current \\ncapabilities, competencies and core compet encies it possesses by creating an environment Figure 1: Business Stream (BS) Competencies \\nGIGAS’ plc BS Com petencies\\nBS1 : Commercial \\nDevelopment \\n \\n1.

But how is that to be achieved? This paper proposes \\nthat the first step is for the mental shift fr om perceiving ICMs as a collection of BS to \\nconceptualizing them as managi ng portfolios of competencies to take place. “Market grouping” \\nhas prevailed in construction because, as Mintzb erg et al. (2003) would suggest, it favors mutual \\nadjustment and direct supervisi on as coordination mechanisms in lower hierarchical tiers of the \\norganization and because the simultaneous manage ment of collections of projects as large \\nentities under market focused BSs assists in ma naging more systematically the linkage between \\nbusiness and project strate gy by linking the intent of the strategic apex with the intent of the \\noperating core (Morris, 2004). However, it could be argued that this co nfiguration hinders the \\nscope for process and scale sp ecialization across the group, by reducing the scope to perform \\nspecialized or repetitive tasks across BSs and across organizational parts operating in different \\ngeographic regions.  \\nAs part of an ongoing research, it has b een observed that successful ICMs exhibit \\nsimilarities in that they have formed temporar y and semi-permanent internal functions in the \\nform of initiatives and ongoing programs in areas  such as risk management, project management, \\nsupply chain management and procurement – to name a few – whose purpose is to capture, \\nnurture and transfer relevant competencies ac ross the group. But is that enough? This paper \\nadvocates a more “hands-on” approach to the ma nagement of organizational competencies. After \\nall, competencies could be  supra-divisional intangible strate gic resources and should be actively \\nmanaged as such. \\nFor any corporate center to develop “compet ence” in competence management and hence \\nthe organization to develop core competencies, an  intentional focus toward s that direction must \\noccur. Perceiving ICMs as managing portfolios of co mpetencies rather than  portfolios of market \\nfocused BSs and BUs, a simple step can be taken to map their competencies as they exist at different parts of the organizatio n in a manner similar to the one shown in figures 1 and 2.

This process might al so assist in setting up more \\nefficient systems for intra-gr oup collaboration. During that pr ocess, the four focal points \\nframework brought forward in this paper can a ssist in categorizing “competence management” \\nissues and plan a strategy to address them that will have a greater chance of success by being more structured and straightforward to manage. ICMs are appropriately structured to implement \\nand exploit competence interrelationships, sin ce they are companies whose competitive strength \\nhas come to depend on their ability to operate  successfully a global ne twork of interrelated \\nactivities across a number of BSs operating in various geographic regions (Langford ad Male, \\n2001). \\nExamining the most likely effects of its application could also support the \\nappropriateness of a competence management approach for ICMs. Adopting such an approach \\nwill most probably lead to a focus on standard ization of skills and norms. Those coordinating \\nmechanisms are the ones Gareis (2004) suggests as being the most appropriate for project \\noriented companies – like ICMs – and those that Mintzberg et al. (2003)  advocate as being the \\nmost appropriate for diversified companies,  such as ICMs. ICMs could work towards \\nstandardizing skills and norms associated with competencies they possess, thus making them \\nmore easily transferable and de ployable across their organiza tion. This could help overcome \\nduplication and waste of resources that obstruct them from achieving the full potential that \\nprocess and scale specialization could offer on a corporate-wide scale. Adopting a competence \\nmanagement approach, ICMs could finally retain their ability to think globally but act locally \\n(Flanagan, 1994) by making their inte rnal strengths available at a corporate wide level, and \\ndeveloping the capability to proactively create a global market rather than merely international \\nones.  \\n \\n \\nReferences \\n \\nArtto, K.A. and Dietrich, P.H.

Successful \\nmanagement of a highly dynamic C&E business can be  based on six elements, i.e. (i) strategizing \\nin these markets, (ii) pacing competitive strategies and tailoring offerings with the best value, (iii) managing processes that capture and carry the ta rgeted value, (iv) investing in platforms that \\ncreate new value streams and (re)placing developm ent paths vis-à-vis core competitiveness, (v) \\nenhancing a business’ frame and its governance, and (vi) nurturing a co llaborative net. Re-\\ninventive business managers avoid target fixati on and grasp opportunities in C&E markets with: \\ninstant or no communica tion, rapid evolution, and chaotic bu siness and project cycles (e.g. those \\nin Russia and China).      \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\n The prior literature review (Huovinen 2003, 2004)  revealed that no established tradition \\nexists in construction-focused business-management research  in any of the OECD countries. \\nOne of the “white” areas involves ways of cr eating, capturing, and distributing value (e.g. for \\nmoney) among owners, investors, contractors, engineers, and othe r stakeholders in construction \\nand engineering (C&E) businesses.              Thus, the objectives  of this paper are as follows: (i) to introduce nine value-based \\nconcepts for managing highly dynamic businesses in general, (ii) to inco rporate the selected \\nvalue-based principles of these generic concepts into the proposed 6-element business system for managing a highly dynamic C&E busine ss, and (iii) to disc uss implications fo r both practitioners \\nand related scholars.  The theoretical base  of this concept-design effort is  limited to a set of nine dynamism-\\nbased and value-based management concep ts published between the years 1994-2003. The \\ncontexts of these concepts are non-C&E businesse s. Nevertheless, it is assumed that their key \\nideas and ways of managing high business dynamis m belong to the few invariants inherent in \\nany highly dynamic (incl. C&E) business.           Herein, value is approached through those value chains and processes that add value to \\nclients  (owners, capital investors) in such terms as value for money to be invested in new \\nconstruction objects or in the re novation of the existing stock. In r eality, value is being created, \\ncaptured, and shared (and destr oyed) daily among stakeholders involved in C&E projects in \\nvarious dynamic (inter)national markets.

Originally, Rappaport \\n(1986/1998) came out with the idea of maximizing shareholder value,  i.e. corporate value \\nminus debt or the economic value of the equity of a business based on forecast data, and shareholder value added, SVA (i .e. the amount of value created by a given scenario). Instead, \\nclient value is approached at the level of business management. This paper complements the \\nvalue-management developments in both the UK and the USA at the level of C&E projects \\n(Male et al. 2005).            The rationale  of this paper unfolds through the in troduction of nine generic management \\nconcepts and the design of a new 6-element concept. Each of the applied elements is initially defined by adopting the eligible pr inciples of the generic concepts . Finally, both the practical and \\nscholarly implications are discussed briefly.                       \\n \\nValue Creation and Capturing in Nine Generic Business-Management Concepts \\n \\n Since the mid-1990s, leading authors in ge neric business management have been \\ndesigning new concepts to enable firms to manage their bus inesses successfully in highly \\nintense, fast-paced, unstable, even chaot ic (inter)national and global markets . The nine \\nselected (sets of) concepts address value creation and capturing from the three perspectives  of \\nhighly dynamic competition, competing firms, and ta rgeted clients. The concepts are compiled in \\nTable 1 in the order of publication, i.e. D’ Aveni and Gunther’s (1994) 7-S management in \\nhypercompetition, Hamel and Prahalad’s (1994) concepts for competing for the future, and \\nHamel’s (1994) three core-competence types as well as Slywotzky’s (1996) value migration, \\nSlywotzky et al.’s (1998) profit zones, Slywotzk y et al.’s (1999) profit patterns, and Bovet and \\nMartha’s (2000) value nets, Ramirez and Wallin’s  (2000) prime movershi p strategy, and Sanchez \\nand Heene’s (2003) virtuous manage ment circle with its strategi c logic in organizations.

Dynamism varies a great deal across various (inter)n ational and global C&E \\nbusinesses. Herein, the focus is on the ways of  strategizing through the highly dynamic end of \\nthe spectrum.      For the task at hand, value crea tion and capturing is adopted as the primary dimension \\nfor re-designing one of the author’s systemic concepts (Huovinen 2002).

Strategizing in hi ghly dynamic C&E markets. Business managers may succeed by \\napplying one or several of th e generic ways of strategizing,  i.e. through: hypercompetition, 4-\\nlevel competition for competence, value migrati on, profit patterns, and/or prime movership. In \\neach case, the choice of the future strategy to  be used for competing depends on both the \\nincumbents’ current strategies and the managers’ own per ceptions on desired or avoidable future.          \\n In C&E hypercompetition , competitors move quickly to build advantages and to erode \\ntheir rivals’ advantages when e .g. clients are changing their prio rities, contractors are offering \\nnew solutions, or local authorities are giving ul timatums. The focal C&E firm may aim at value \\ndisruptions that create superior  client satisfaction in terms of identifying new needs, finding \\nunserved clients, creating new needs, and/or pred icting changes. Strategic soothsaying allows the \\nfirm to see or create new needs that it can serv e best, even if only tem porarily (D’Aveni with \\nGunther 1994).  In the 4-level C&E competition for core competence , understanding the nature of the \\ncompetition at each level is critical to establishing leadership: develop-ing and accessing constituent skills and technologies  (level 1), synthesizing them  into core competencies and \\nproducts (level 2), competing for core-product  share (level 3), and maximizing end-product \\nshares (level 4) (Ham el and Prahalad 1994). \\n In the value-migration process , the focal C&E firm aims at  inventing a business design \\nwith a prolonged value-creation po wer through three states, namely those of inflow, stability, and \\noutflow. (i) In the inflow state, value moves (rapidly at times) to ward (new) activities and skills, \\nand also toward the focal firm’s new busine ss design whose superiority  in meeting client \\npriorities makes profit possible.  (ii) In the stability state, the business design matches to the \\nclients’ priorities and the equi librium among competing firms, but value may remain either over \\nseveral years or for only some months. (i ii) In the outflow state, value starts to move away from \\nthe firm to new business designs that more eff ectively meet evolving client priorities (Slywotzky \\n1996).   Profit patterns of change  can be adopted to understa nd how the strategic C&E \\nlandscape is deforming itself toward tomorrow’s topology. Often 3-4 patterns take place at the \\nsame time. The pattern-cycle time may vary. A pattern can have several variants, versions \\ncreated by the differences in their development a nd the creativity with wh ich they are exploited \\nby C&E firms. Patterns describe those busine ss designs that are becoming even client-\\ncompelling and extremely profitable. Patterns also  describe which business designs are becoming \\neconomically obsolete. C&E firm s that will become value gr owth leaders through pattern \\nrecognition also have the opportunity to become  value polarization winners (Slywotzky et al. \\n1999).    \\n Prime movers  may succeed in moving C&E businesses by getting others to follow the \\nway they (co-)design and reconfi gure the business in terms of fi nding out new contractual, risk-\\nallocating ways of doing busines s by reallocating project roles among actors that enhance value-\\ncreation (Ramirez and Wallin 2000).

Providing high  client value by compet itive moves and offerings . C&E \\nfirms may aim at offering the best value to the ta rgeted clients and managing the contracts to be \\nwon profitably. Alternative competitive mo ves include hypercompetitive behavior, i.e. \\ngenerating a flow of new advantages, moving fast er than competitors, restarting new cycles, or \\nentering new arenas, and destroying  or neutralizing the opponent’s advantage, thereby destroying \\nperfect competition (D’Aveni and Gunther 1994). A firm’s value-providing offerings enable it to \\npre-empt client needs, to excel among competitors , and to meet its own short-term aims. Client \\npriorities provide insight into which busine ss design will serve her/him best (Slywotzky 1996). \\nIn the form of an equation, client value = net satisfaction contribution (or how well the offering \\nsupports the clients’ value creation minus purch asing price minus interface (purchasing) cost \\nminus integration cost (as part of the client’s system ) minus life-cycle cost (cost-in-use) minus \\nproject-transaction risk plus le arning/information transfer adva ntages. A 3-dimensional offering \\nencompasses hardware (e.g. a building), software  (e.g. client service support), and peopleware \\n(Ramirez and Wallin 2000).    Element 3. Leveraging and capturin g value through business processes . C&E firms \\nmay aim at integrating their global, local, and contract-specific business processes to ensure \\neffectiveness. Processes and contracts can be managed as a matrix where teams play integrative roles. This matrix is based on a firm’s market -access, integrity-related, and other competences \\n(Hamel 1994). Future digital value nets or pr ocesses allow clients to self-design buildings, \\nspaces, infrastructures, or products and choose the offering attributes they value most. Agile, \\ndigital, scalable, and fast-low sourcing, manuf acturing, delivery, and associated services or \\nprocesses are to be differentiated to match each client segment (Bovet and Martha 2000). \\n Element 4. Managing value-creating platforms and value-developing paths . C&E \\nfirms may aim at nurturing their co re technologies, competences, and offerings in order to create \\nnew advantages and/or to prolong the curre nt ones. Platforms are based on: opportunity \\nperceptions, technology foresights, a core-competence architecture, a core-offering portfolio, and \\nrelated value-developing paths. Generative an d transformative competences are used for the \\nimagination, the development, and the design of new offerings (Ramirez and Wallin 2000). Business-design innovations are ma naged through value-growth tr ajectories. Customer-centric \\nthinking is a core skill of a business re-inventor to prevent today’s profit  zones from becoming \\ntomorrow’s no-profit zones (Slywotzky et al. 1 998). Various races for future technology-based \\nC&E businesses may occur in three overlapping stag es, i.e. competition (a) for business foresight \\nand intellectual leadership,  (b) to foreshor ten migration paths (preemptively building core \\ncompetences), and (c) for market position/share. C&E firms need to nurture core competences, \\ni.e. the bundles of skills and tec hnologies that: (a) make a dispr oportionate contribution to client \\nvalue, i.e. enable the delivery of fundamental c lient benefits over the lif e-cycles of buildings \\nand/or infrastructure, (b) are co mpetitively unique, (c) enable an  array of new offerings to be \\nissued, and/or (d) yield a cost ad vantage (Hamel and Prahalad 1994). \\n Element 5. Enhancing value within a firm frame and governance system . C&E \\nfirms may aim at governing their business-speci fic frames to optimize their existence and \\nshareholding. Governance takes place along legal, financial,  venturous, organizational, \\ninstitutional, social, and e nvironmental dimensions. A fram e facilitates ownership, top \\nmanagement, business venturing, fi nancing, and the preferred ways of firm-market interactions. \\nStrategic logic can be defined for sustaining coor dinated deployments of resources in ways that ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The virtuous circle of value creation is managed \\nthrough five processes, i.e. managers are self-g uided to: (i) discover oppor tunities, (ii) define \\nofferings, (iii) manage resources, (iv) manage uncer tainties, and (v) distribut e value created to all \\nresource providers (Sanchez and Heene 2003).   Element 6. Delivering more value through value nets . C&E firms may aim at \\nextending their business-specific frames by networ king with local or foreign stakeholders. The \\nnature of a given relationship va ries according to stakeholder roles. Alternative forms include \\ne.g. those of consortiums, joint ventures, subcon tracting, partnerships, ne tworks, and value nets. \\nThese value constellations provid e new offerings and they are li nked to clients’ value-creation \\nprocesses (Ramirez and Wallin 2000). Virtual value ne ts are fast, flexible supply systems aligned \\nwith and driven by new client-choice mechanis ms. The focal firm may control client-touch \\npoints through digitally integrated  service and support. Clients’ ch oices are transmitted in real \\ntime to net participants through seamless webs of client choices and delivery competences \\n(Bovet and Martha 2000).  \\n \\nDiscussion  \\n \\n The initial implications for C&E business ma nagers are discussed as follows. On the \\none hand, it is argued that most business managers find it vital to determin e the current degree of \\nbusiness dynamism and foresee its future levels . This understanding is a prerequisite for any \\n(team of) business managers who consider adop ting one or several dynamism and value-based \\nways of managing. On the other hand, avoiding target fixation a nd leading the firm toward new \\nopportunities seems to be re-inventive managers’  single most important role in a highly \\ndynamic C&E business with instan t or no communication, rapidly evolving markets, and short \\nbusiness-design cycles. For this, a firm’s collect ive mind needs to be open and on the lookout for \\nthe next major changes (aligning wi th Slywotzky et al. 1998: 287).  \\n The validity of nine generic references can be readily questioned in the context of C&E \\nbusinesses. However, it is proposed herein that a set of invariant-like ways of managing a \\nhighly dynamic business  turn out to be applicable in most specific business contexts. These \\ninvariants may include introducing the new in ter-locked ways of creating, capturing, and \\ndistributing the highest client va lue (Element 1), generating (and destroying) new (existing) sub-\\nofferings and competitive advantages continuously (Element 2), integrating transparent end-to-end business processes (Element 3), investing in both core competitiveness platforms and their irreversible but replaceable de velopment paths (Element 4), e nhancing a business-focused frame \\nand governance system (Element 5), and managing one or several value nets with internal \\ncompetition among replaceable stakeholders (E lement 6).              \\n Finally, some promising ways of advancing and testing dynamism and value-based \\nconcepts  are put forth to scholars related to C&E businesses as follows. (i) Many scholars find \\nvalue-based ways of managing C&E businesses to be a challenging research area. Indeed, it is \\nrelevant to couple future endeavors with a partic ular C&E business context in order to grasp its \\nevolution, preferably during a l ongitudinal investigation. (ii) Th e internet based search among \\ndatabases will turn out to be very useful fo r finding theoretical building blocks and, thus, \\nconceptualizing the value-based management of C & E businesses.  The eligible search words \\ninclude at least those of business value, buyer/client/custo mer value, value-based management, \\nand value appropriation/capture/ capturing/configurati on/ creation/proposition.

It uses a multi-\\ncase research design with interview data from four types of firms—Sy stems Contractors who \\nsell, test and deliver integrated technical syst ems; Project Consultant s who plan, manage and \\ncontrol large projects on behalf  of a client; General Contractor s who undertake responsibility for \\noverall project delivery; and De velopers who finance, acquire land and develop a facility for \\ncommercial use. The research design invokes two l ogics: a theoretical replic ation logic, i.e. the \\nlevel of embeddedness varies across  the four types of firms; a nd a two-way literal replication \\nlogic, i.e. there are two firms of each type . The findings indicate that with increasing \\nembeddedness in a new market, firms face greater emergent uncertainty. This affects strategic \\ndecisions such as entry mode, staffing and cent ralization. The findings also articulate three \\ngeneral strategies of entrant firms: increas ing the supply of local knowledge, decreasing the \\ndemand for local knowledge, and reducing the im pact of a local knowledge deficit. These \\nstrategies refute the myth that entrant performance is tied to climbing a “country learning curve”, \\nbut, instead imply that dodging th e need to learn and avoiding th e costs of not learning can be \\nequally effective.  \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\nIn this article, we begin the empirical anal ysis of the link between  level of embeddedness \\nin an unfamiliar market context, level of need for local knowledge and strategies to cope with a \\nlocal knowledge deficit. In doing so, we seek to develop a grounded theo ry by integrating the \\nexperiences of managers engaged in the planni ng, design and management of large engineering \\nprojects situated in overseas markets. \\nDespite differing aims and the use of a variet y of terms and nuanced definitions, scholars \\nwho write about entering foreign markets repeat edly employ key terms that are conceptually \\nsimilar. The terms “liability of foreignness”  (Hymer, 1976), “cultural distance” (Kogut & Singh, \\n1989), “institutional distance” (K ostova, 1999), “psychic dist ance” (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977) \\nand “political risk” (Kobrin, 1979) each have a long and rich history in the international business \\nliterature.  Yet all imply a common assumption: that foreign firms face challenges and, perhaps, even outsider disadvantages, when they  enter new or unfamiliar markets. \\n                                                \\n \\n4 This article summarizes a 50 page manuscript; pleas e contact the authors to request the manuscript.

As noted \\nby Melin (1992), they entirely igno re the entrant’s embeddedness in  the local context.  Most \\nstudies suggest, albeit implicitly, that two firm s from Country A who enter Country B will suffer \\nequally from “liabilities of foreignness”, “cultura l distance”, “psychic distance”, “institutional \\ndistance” and other forms of “risk”. For example,  many scholars have discussed the concept of \\n“foreignness” in a language that implies an amor phous disadvantage or liability that trickles \\ndown and touches all entrants evenly (eg. L uo & Peng, 1999). Likewise, many discussions of \\n“country risk” or “political risk” imply a halo of misfortune that  floats down to plague every \\nventure within the boundary of a given nation-stat e uniformly (eg. Kobrin, 1979). But is it really \\ntrue that all entrants face th e same outsider disadvantage?  \\n \\nMethods \\n \\nTable 1 portrays the eight firms studied.

Project descriptions. \\n \\nData Sources & Analysis. Data collection involved project vi sits and interviews: open-ended \\ninterviews in the early stages, and structured interviews towards the e nd of the study (Spradly, \\n1979).  As is typical in building a grounded theo ry, data analysis followed three distinct, yet \\niterative phases. As Glaser and Strauss explai n (1967: 105): “first, coding each incident in the \\ndata into as many categories of analysis as possi ble and comparing incidents [in] each category; \\nsecond, integrating categories and their properties…resulting in a unified … theory; and third, \\ndelimiting the theory…and reformulating it with a smaller set of high level concepts.”  \\n \\nChallenges in Foreign Markets \\n \\nMany studies in international business suggest  a link between the performance of foreign \\nentrants and measures of “cultural distan ce” (Kogut & Singh, 1989), “i nstitutional distance” \\n(Kostova, 1999) and “psychic distance” (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977). Studies that take this perspective make the implicit assumption that cultural, institutiona l and psychic distance \\nencumber all foreign entrants equally . \\n \\nEmbeddedness.  The data from this research suggests th at this assumption is mistaken. Certainly, \\nas extant theories well predict, firms that enter foreign markets face unexpected conditions and incur unforeseen costs when they misjudge and misunderstand local cultures and institutions. \\nHowever, these conditions and costs are not uniformly  distributed across all entrants, as \\npreviously had been assumed. Instead, our findings s uggest that each type of firm faces a distinct \\nlevel of embeddedness  in the host country context.  Our evidence reveals that the level of \\nembeddedness is different for every entrant, b ecause every type of entrant has specialized \\nobjectives, resource needs, activities, regulatory re quirements, levels of exposure to civil society \\nand industry affiliations. Our results are suggestive of the fact that as entrants become more \\nheavily embedded in the local context, they need  more local knowledge in  order to anticipate, \\nassess and adapt to the locally determined ideas, interests and institutions.

More formally,  \\n \\nProposition 1: The more deeply an entrant is embe dded in an unfamiliar market setting, the more \\nlocal knowledge is needed to achieve objectives and avoid unforeseen costs. \\n \\nTable 3 displays evidence to show that embeddedness varies signi ficantly for different \\ntypes of global project entrants. Embeddedness  is defined as a measure of the total number of \\nrelations between a global project entrant a nd local organizations. Relations with local \\norganizations are grouped into four categories:  formal regulatory, formal market, informal \\ncommunity and informal project.5 \\nTable 3 reveals that, as a class, General C ontractors face by far th e greatest level of \\nembeddedness, with a low of 669, a high of 1680 a nd a mean of 1172 total relations with local \\nentities. On the other end of th e spectrum, Table 3 shows that the Systems Contractors face the \\nlowest level of embeddedness, with a low of 18, a high of 78 and a mean of 52 relations with \\nlocal entities. Thus, the leve l of embeddedness is not uniform, although past studies have \\nassumed uniformity of embeddedness or have ignored its effects. Rather, diffe rent types of firms, \\nwith different kinds of work and activities, face dramatically diffe rent levels of engagement with \\norganizations and institutions in the host environment. \\n \\nConsequences of embeddedness . The consequence of embeddedne ss is that for every activity \\nassociated with local actors or institutions, an  entrant requires a certain  basic level of local \\nknowledge about those elements. If the rele vant elements are well understood prior to \\nperforming the task, much of the activity can be planned in advance and the task is accomplished \\nin the most efficient fashion at a minimum level of effort to the responsible manager (Galbraith, \\n1973). If these elements are not well understood, then institutional exceptions—misjudgments, \\nmisunderstandings and conflict— arise that lead to  changes in priorities, plans and strategies. \\nOur evidence, which is presented in our longer arti cle, suggests that all of  these changes require \\nsense-making, trial-and-error learning, adap tation and a high lik elihood of relational \\nMin Max Mean Min Max Mean Min Max Mean Min Max Mean\\nFormal Regulatory Relations 9 24 17 35 4 82 9 14 12 21 16.75\\nFormal Market Relations 12 220 78 95 5 36 50 95 64 640 1600 1123\\nInformal Community Relations 3 55 22 00 0 51 5 10 52 8 1 2\\nInformal Project Relations 12 380 166 61 8 12 05 2 12 31 20.75\\nTotal Number of Relations 36 679 282 18 78 52 63 144 90 669 1680 1172\\naN = 17.

Therefore, the greater an entrant’s knowledge defi cit at the outset of a task, \\nthe greater the likelihood that sense-making, tr ial-and-error learning, and adaptation will be \\nnecessary during task execution. Thus, the central e ffect of an actor’s loca l knowledge deficit is a \\nlimited ability to anticipate issues , set priorities, develop strate gies or make decisions about \\nactivities in advance of their execution.  \\n \\nEmergent Uncertainty.  Recently, a number of author s (eg. Han & Diekmann, 2001; Chua, \\nWang & Tan, 2003; Chan & Tse, 2003; Wade, 2005) have written about political, cultural and \\nsocial “risks” in foreign ma rkets in tones that imply a priori predictability. Similarly, many \\nsoftware vendors and consultants6 suggest in their marketing materi als that political instabilities, \\ncultural conflicts and social upri sings can be assessed and predic ted with probabilistic tools and \\ntechniques. \\nOur findings contradict this  view. We find that these approaches, which rely on \\nsubjective probability assessments, are largely unre liable without recent and relevant in-country \\nexperience. We also find that relational interact ions with host entities often lead to critical \\nincident scenarios that are extremely difficult to predict a priori , and, can only be managed as \\nthey occur. Thus, we conclude that as entrants face greater le vels of embeddedness, they also \\nface more frequent situations of emergent unc ertainty, where unexpected factors and dynamics \\narise. Thus, \\n \\nProposition 2: The more an entrant is embedded in an unfamiliar market setting: 2a) the less likely that a priori risk analysis approaches will help to prevent unforeseen costs; and 2b) the more likely that emergent relational dy namics will generate unforeseen costs. \\n \\nFirm-Specific Strategies \\n \\nMany studies have examined the process of or ganizations learning to succeed in foreign \\nmarkets (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977; Eriksson et . al., 1997). Other rela ted studies have \\nemphasized one or another specific aspect of this  process, such as, mode or sequence of foreign \\nmarket entry (eg. Brouthers, 2002; Pan, Li & Tse, 1999). \\nThese studies tend to have two key limitations . First, in empirical analyses, there is \\ntypically a high degree of aggregation of da ta across industry sub-groups (eg. Erramilli, 1991; \\nBrouthers, 2002), usually to ensure  a statistically signi ficant sample size, but at the cost of \\nignoring unique drivers and dynamics that characterize each sub-group. Second, embeddedness \\nhas not been seriously consider ed as a determinant of the le vel of need for organizational \\nlearning or strategic decisions.  \\nIn contrast, our study explores the effect s of variance along the embeddedness dimension \\nand finds that it plays an important role in how  different types of orga nizations perceive and \\nlearn about the challenges in foreign markets. Moreover, our data confirm that embeddedness is \\na primary determinant of entry strategy, staffing po licy and organization stru cture. This confirms \\nMelin’s (1992) observation, that “when studying in ternationalization within a strategy process \\nframework, it is crucial to focus on ‘organizations  in their sectors (Chi ld, 1988).’” Our evidence, \\nwhich is discussed in depth in our lo nger article, suggests several propositions, \\n \\n                                                 \\n6 For example: Control Risks Group ( http://www.crg.com/ ), Pegasus Consulting Inc. \\n(http://www.pegasusconsultinginc.com/ ), and Pertmaster Project Risk ( http://www.pertmaster.com ).

Luo & Peng, 1999). Yet, despite these \\nadvances, there has been little e ffort to describe what firms act ually learn as they accumulate \\nglobal experience or to unpack the black box of  “general internationalization knowledge” that \\nhas been alluded to by prior scholars (eg. Peters en & Pedersen, 2002). Specifically, what types of \\ngeneral strategies do firms devise in order to combat the challe nges of embeddedness and \\nemergent uncertainty? \\nIn response to this question, our evidence suggests that firms evolve multiple variants of three \\ngeneral strategies: learning, avoiding learning, and avoi ding the costs of not learning.  Instances \\nof these general strategies are explained in detail in our longer manuscript and were observed \\nrepeatedly across all eight firms, across all observed  market and project settings.

The figure also depicts an array of tactical \\nstrategies, each of which conve rge on one of the general stra tegies, representing different \\npathways for an entrant can to minimize unfor eseen costs and maximize project performance. \\nWe hypothesize that these three general strate gies are exhaustive from a knowledge-based \\nperspective. Yet, while each offe rs a theoretically dis tinct means to cost minimization, they are \\nnot always separable when observe d in the field, nor do they come for free. On the contrary, they \\noften come bundled together, and firms select th em in order of decreasing cost-effectiveness \\nuntil diminishing marginal returns discount  further strategic action (North, 1990).  \\n \\nLearning How to Circumvent th e “Country Learning Curve” \\n \\nA number of studies have pres ented theoretical arguments to  suggest a “learning-curve” \\nor “experience curve” relations hip between the time spent in a given host country and \\noperational performance (Luo & Peng, 1999). \\nOur evidence contradicts this view. What we  find, in our sample of highly experienced \\ninternational firms, is a deft ability to circumvent  the learning curve. That is, entrants are able to \\nsucceed with only minimal learning about the lo cal business and instituti onal environment in a \\nnew host country. More formally, \\n \\nProposition 5: As firms internationalize, they le arn to circumvent the country learning curve, by \\n“ingesting” locals, reducing the need to le arn about local institutions, and reducing the \\nconsequences of not learning.  \\nThree main “circumvention strategies” were  observed. First, strategies to avoid \\nlearning—e.g., hiring locals, partne ring, and acquiring local firms. S econd, strategies to decrease \\nexposure to local actors and inst itutions—e.g., off-shoring and outs ourcing. Finally, strategies to \\nreduce the severity of unforeseen conditions or events—e.g., planning for contingencies and \\ndesigning adaptive organizations. \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nThis article has explored the link between an entrant’s embeddedness in an unfamiliar \\nmarket environment, level of need for germane local knowledge, and strategies to cope with a \\nlocal knowledge deficit. Overall, this research  proposes a new, grounded-theoretic view of the \\nstrategies firms actually develop as they le arn to cope with embeddedness and emergent \\nuncertainty in foreign markets and it identifies a clear link between these strategies and firm \\nperformance. For international bus iness managers, this article offers a “toolkit” of strategic \\noptions to improve overseas performance.

This paper su mmaries a framework for project information \\nmanagement and discussed some of the organi zational issues relating to its implementation. \\nIntroduction \\nProject performance in the architecture, engi neering, construction and facilities management \\nindustries (collectively referred to simply as “construction” here) coul d be improved through a \\nmore explicit and well-defined Project Information Management  function.  This is especially \\nimportant in the face of current trends in information and communication technologies (ICT)  \\nthat are yielding a wide ra nge of new computer-based t ools—everything from project \\ncollaboration web sites to virt ual building environments—which promise great increases in the \\neffectiveness and efficiency of designing and ma naging construction projects.  Yet these systems \\nare often complex and the improvements come at a co st in terms of required changes to skill sets, \\nwork practices, and organi zational structure.   \\nWe are interested in contributing to the develo pment of project information management as a \\nwell-defined sub-discipline of proj ect management.  To date, this  work represents early-phase \\nresearch in which we are devel oping conceptual models and appr oaches (prior to field-based \\nresearch and implementation of the technique s).  Elsewhere (Froese 2004, 2005), we have \\ndiscussed conceptual models that aid in the un derstanding of the role and context for ICT in \\nconstruction, developed a conceptual framework for project information management, discussed \\nsome of the organization implications (including the role of a Project Information Officer, or \\nPIO), and explored the impact on project manageme nt as a whole.  This paper summarizes our \\nproposed approach to project information manage ment and then further explores alternative \\norganizational configurations th at might be appropriate for im plementing project information \\nmanagement in various construction contexts. \\nInformation Management as a Sub-Di scipline of Project Management \\nInformation and information management have always been recognized as important aspects \\nof project management.

The same can be said for \\ninformation management.  For example, one ch apter of the Project Management Institute’s \\nProject Management Body of Knowledge (PMI  2000) defines a comm unications planning \\nframework, yet this falls well short of a comprehensive approach to project information management.  Information management seems fa r behind the areas of cost, schedule, scope, \\nsafety, risk, or quality as a well defined and understood sub-discipline of  project management. \\nWe contend that improved project informati on management could improve performance on \\nany construction project t oday.  Yet it becomes much more significant as projects adopt more \\nadvanced, emerging ICT, such as building informa tion models (BIM’s).  Indeed, we contend that \\na careful consideration of how information management prac tices could adopt new ICT provides \\nthe essential bridge to move new ICT fr om development into industrial practice. \\nA Framework for Project Information Management \\nA comprehensive list of all of the issues invol ved in the management of information systems \\nfor construction can grow very long indeed.  To  provide some structure to these issues, we \\npropose that project informati on management be defined as the management\\n of information \\nsystems  to meet project  objectives .  Though simple, this definition suggests a breakdown of \\nproject information management into  four main topic dimensions:  a management process , \\nproject elements , information system elements , and  objectives .  The following sections examine \\neach of these topics. \\nA Management Process for Information Management \\nThe management of information systems s hould follow general management processes: \\n• Plan  all aspects of information system.  This  includes analyzing the requirements and \\nalternatives, designing a suitabl e solution taking into account al l objectives and constraints, \\nand adequately documenting the plan so th at it can be communicated to all.   \\n• Implement  the plan, including issues such as secu ring the necessary auth ority and resources \\nfor the plan, implementing co mmunication, training, etc. \\n• Monitor  the results, including appropriate data co llection relative to established performance \\nmeasures and taking necessary corrective action. \\nOther generic management processes such as  scope definition, initiating and closing the \\nproject, iterating through increas ingly detailed cycles of the plan-implementation-monitoring \\nsequence, etc. are all equally applicable. \\nThese generic management processes should be applied in the form of specific management \\npractices tailored to the needs of individual proj ects.  In the field of quality management, as a \\ncomparison, generic management and quality principles can be implemented in the form of a specific ISO9001 process, in which a project’s quality plan is documented in a quality manual \\nthat includes a collection of specific work methods statements.  Similarly, a project’s information \\nmanagement plan can be documented in an in formation management manual that includes, \\namong other things, a collection of information management methods statements , which describe ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This can involve the same project \\nwork breakdown structures used for other asp ects of project management (e.g., breaking the \\nproject down by discipline, work package, etc.).  However, there are perspectives on decomposing the work that are of  particular relevance to info rmation systems.  Adopting the \\nprocesses view of the project as a basis for st ructuring information ma nagement, the approach \\nshould focus on three aspects: project tasks, in formation transactions, and overall integration \\nissues.  The process should define these elemen ts, including identifying participants, project \\nphase, etc. (this should correspond  largely to an overall project plan and schedule, and thus it \\nmay not need to be done as a distinct activity).  Then, for each of these elements, the information management process should analyze informati on requirements, design information management \\nsolutions, and produce specific information manage ment deliverables (this is generally at the \\nlevel that various work packages must interact w ith each other, not into the details of how each \\nparticipant performs their own work packages). \\nThe model considers these elements across all pr oject participants (spanning all participating \\ncompanies, not just internal to one company), and the information management tasks should be \\ncarried out for each of these project elements. \\n \\nInformation System Elements \\nFor each of the project elements to which we  are applying our information management \\nprocesses, there are a number of  different elements of an information system that must be \\nconsidered: \\n• Information\\n: Foremost, we must consider the inform ation involved in each of the project \\nelements.  First, the process should assess th e significant information input requirements for \\neach element, determining the t ype of information required for carrying out the tasks, the \\ninformation communicated in the transactions, or the requirements for integration issues.  With traditional information t echnologies, information require ments generally correspond to \\nspecific paper or electronic documents.  With  building information models and other newer \\ninformation technologies, however, informati on requirements can involve access to specific \\ndata sources (such as specific application da ta files or shared da tabases) that do not \\ncorrespond to traditional documents.  Sec ond, we must assess tool requirements by \\ndetermining the key software applications used in carrying out tasks, communication \\ntechnologies used for transactions, or standard s used to support integration.  Third, we must \\nassess the significant information outputs produced by each task.  This typically corresponds \\nto information required as inputs to other task s.  After analysis, these results should be \\nformalized in the information systems plan as the information required as inputs for each \\ntask, and the information that each task must commit to producing. \\n• Resources:\\n the information management process should analyze the requirements, investigate \\nalternatives, and design specific solutions for al l related resources.  These include hardware, \\nsoftware, networking and other infrastructure, human resources , authority, and third party \\n(contracted) resources.

While \\nthis focus on the conceptual frameworks and management processes pr ovides one leg to the \\npractice of project information management, th e other leg consists of the technical body of \\nknowledge that underpins the information system s used throughout the construction industry.  \\nIdeally, there would be a well developed and widely understood body of knowledge for this \\ndiscipline—but this does not seem to exist.  At present, technical exper tise is built up mainly \\nthrough extensive industry experi ence with little in the way of  unifying underlying theory or \\nframeworks.  Recent developments such as Master degree programs focusing on construction \\nICT (e.g., the European Masters program in C onstruction ICT, Rebolj and Menzel, 2004) are \\nhelping to contribute to a more formalize body of knowledge for both traditional and emerging \\nconstruction ICT.  A further c onsideration of the technical body of knowledge is outside the \\nscope of this paper. \\nOrganizational Roles: The Project Information Officer \\nOrganizational Issues for Information Management \\nThe following challenging criteria must be considered in defining the organizational \\nresponsibility for information management: \\n• Project focus:  information management should be proj ect-focused and organized as a project \\nmanagement function, as opposed to centralized within a corporate ICT department.  The \\ninformation management process, as describe d above, is tightly co upled to the project \\nprocesses and, inversely, the project proces ses should be strongly influenced by the ICT \\nperspective.  Furthermore, the information management must be responsive to project \\nobjectives and the needs of all pr oject participants, rather than  being driven by the corporate \\nobjectives and the needs of one company alone.  This does not imply that a centralized ICT \\ngroup is not needed:  the depth of ICT exper tise and resources require d may be well-served \\nthrough some centralized resources.  Thus, a matr ix organizational structure may be suitable, \\nwith primary organizational res ponsibility for information mana gement residing in a project \\nposition supported by a centralized inform ation management group (although matrix \\norganizational structures are generally not ideal , their use here would be similar to other \\ncommon applications in the c onstruction industry such as es timating or field engineering \\nservices). \\n• High level:   since information management is centr al to the overall project management, it \\nshould not be relegated to a low level within  the project organizational structure (e.g., as \\nmight be found with typical ICT support personnel),  but should be the primary responsibility \\nof someone within the senior  project management team. \\n• Separate function:   Although the responsibility for in formation management should lie \\nwithin the senior project management team, it would often be a poor fit with other project \\nmanagement functions and curren t senior project management st aff.  It requires a depth of \\nspecialized knowledge in areas of technology that are rapidly evolving.  It may also be \\novershadowed by traditional practices if it is added as a new, additional responsibility to \\nsomeone that already handles ot her aspects of the project mana gement, such as a contracts \\nmanager, a project controls engineer, or the overall project manager.   Therefore, project \\ninformation management should be clearly define d as a distinct projec t management function \\nand, where possible, assigned to personnel de dicated specifically to that role.   \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We call such a position the Project \\nInformation Officer (PIO) .  The overall responsibility of the PIO is to implement the \\ninformation management as described previously .  However, no single solution for implementing \\nproject information management will be ideal for all projects.  Rather, ideal organizational solutions will depend on a number of factors, not th e least of which are the size of the project and \\nthe relative complexity of the information systems to be used.  A number of  factors contribute to \\nthe level of ICT complexity—a project may be cons idered to have low ICT complexity only if all \\nof the information management process and key ICT software systems are mature implementations that have previously been successf ully used by the key project participants (i.e., \\nno innovation), and there is nothing extraordin ary in the information requirements or \\norganization makeup of the project.  The fo llowing suggest some possible organizational \\nconfigurations that may be appropriate: \\n• Small projects/low ICT complexity:   For small, simple projects, it may be sufficient for the \\nproject manager(s) to incl ude information management as one of the responsibi lities that they \\nmust carry out on the project.  It may be tr eated quite informally, but it must still be \\nconsidered as an explicit responsibility.  In this configuration, the project manager(s) must \\nhave some expertise in projec t information management appropriate to the systems being \\nused.  There would be no formal PIO position. \\n• Medium-sized projects /low ICT complexity:   For larger projects with no unusual ICT \\nrequirements (e.g., no major innovations), it may be appropriate to formally define a project \\ninformation management function and to assign the position of PIO as one of the duties of \\nsomeone on the project management team.  Fo r example, a project controls manager may \\nresponsible for scheduling and cost control in addition to being the PIO.  This person should \\nhave good expertise in project information management. \\n• Large projects/high ICT complexity:   For large projects, or any projects with challenging ICT \\nrequirements (e.g., the introduction of innova tive, advanced ICT systems), project \\ninformation management should be a well-defi ned, distinct project management function \\nassigned to a full-time PIO indivi dual or group.  Here, the PIO would have a high level of \\nexpertise in the practice of pr oject information management a nd in the specific technologies \\nto be used. \\n \\nThe Project Information Officer \\nThere are also various alternatives for staffing the PIO position. The PIO may be an \\nemployee of the project owner, l ead designer, or lead contractor organiza tions, or may work as \\nan independent consultant/contractor.  Regardless  of employer, the PIO should be considered to \\nbe a resource to the project as a whole, not to an individual project part icipant organization.  The \\nPIO should be a senior manageme nt-level position within the pr oject organization (i.e., not a \\njunior technology support position) .  The PIO should report to th e owner's project representative \\nand work with an information management committee consisting of project managers and \\ninformation specialists from key project participan ts.  Depending upon the size  of the project, the \\nPIO may have an independent staff.  In addi tion to the information management committee, \\nliaison positions should be assigned within each project participant organization.  As in the \\nmedium-size project example above, the PIO could be combined with other areas of expertise, such as project controls or quality management .  The PIO position could also be supplemented \\nwith a specialist consultant to add specific exper tise and/or to assist with certain information \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This will not be a direct measure, but will be assessed on an overall qualitative basis \\nthrough an information management review proce sses that examines the following questions of \\nthe information management and technology for the project: \\n• To what degree was waste (any non-value-adding activity) reduced? \\n• What new functionality was available? \\n• How efficient and problem-free was the inform ation management and technology relative to \\nprojects with similar levels of ICT in the past? \\n• What was the level of service and management effectiveness offered by the PIO? \\n• What is the potential for future improveme nts gained by the information management \\npractices on this project (i.e., recognizing the lo ng learning curve that may be associated with \\nnew ICT)? \\nThere is a need for the development of good metr ics and data about industry norms related to \\nthese issues. \\nConclusion \\nIn summary, emerging ICT offer great potential to improve project outcomes, but they come \\nat a cost.  They involve complex systems with high technical and organizational requirements.  \\nCurrent practices for managing project informati on and ICT need to evolve and current skills \\nneed to improve.

Not only technical, but  also organizational aspects are taken into \\nconsideration. The developed innovation planni ng matrix helps identifying the chance of sim-\\nulation to become an innovation, i.e. a marketab le product in a specified application field. The \\nuse case ‘Material flow in buildin gs projects’ demonstrates the pe rspectives of this approach. \\nIntroduction \\nA great deal of research efforts during the la st two decades considers simulation as a very \\npromising project planning and controlling met hod for construction management. These studies \\ndemonstrated how simulation can be successfully  applied to improve planning and analyzing \\nprocesses in construction. The benefits of simulation are well kno wn for the industrial \\nengineering in view of the fact th at a lot of applications and soft ware products were successfully \\ndeveloped. Simulation enables stochastic an d dynamic analysis of a system and helps \\nconsequently designing and desc ribing its behavior over time. So, the process of making and \\njustifying a decision is significantly simp lified. Implementing simulation technology in \\nconstruction management promises even more pot entials than just modeling system operations \\nand utilizing resources efficiently. Simulation constr ains transparency and structure at process as \\nwell as at project level and can therefore be an excell ent communication instrument. \\nNevertheless only a negligible transfer into the practice can be observed and simulation is not yet \\nacknowledged as a method for planning a nd controlling of construction sites \\n(AbouRizk et. al. \\n1992). The complex nature of both structure and pr ogress of construction operations restricts the \\nuse of simulation in practice. Applying simulation consumes therefore a lot of costs and time for \\ncollecting data and training the staff to work w ith a simulation tool. Th is fact might be the \\nreason, why responsible managers are not motivated  to implement simulation in their every day \\nwork.  \\nMany researches believed to fi nd the solution for this proble m in developing the technical \\ncapabilities of simulation tools and making them user-friendly. The results of these research \\nefforts led to develop special approaches fo r construction simulation like CYCLONE (Halpin \\n1977), CIPROS (Odeh et.al. 1992), STROPOSC OPE (Martinez 1996). Additional approaches \\nfollowed the same aspect and focused on simplif ying the modeling process by developing special \\npurpose simulation tools (SPS) (Hajjar, AbouRi zk 1998). Other papers dealt with general \\nsimulation concepts and their a pplication to construction industr y (Petri nets, block-oriented \\ntools) (Franz 1989), (Franz, Chahrour 2002). Thes e concepts are successf ully used in other \\nindustries, and can also be applied to the construction industry, as these works approved.

The \\nfirst step is to define relevant factors that he lp transforming the simulation technology from just \\nbeing a technical invention to be an innovation for construction management. In this sense an \\ninnovation is a market- and user- oriented product. Construction firms should be able to integrate \\nit with other management systems. That is  why identifying the demands of construction \\nmanagement, both technical and organizational ones , and the contributions of simulation to these \\ndemands are very essential in defining  the previously me ntioned factors. \\nThe demands of the construction management depend on the complexity of the systems to be \\nmanaged. Not only the ‘project or ganization’ itself, but also parts of relating national and \\ninternational economy were characterized by si gnificant changes during the last decade. For \\ninstance an increasing number of participants, like subcontractors, supp liers, etc., more price \\ndumping, tighter scheduled construction time ar e counted to the significant changes concerning \\nconstruction management in Germany. Thes e make coordination and organization more \\ncomplicated. To overcome this increasing co mplexity a better know-how and innovative \\nmethods, like simulation, are more and more recommended. Taking these developments into \\naccount, the main question turns into: how can simulation improve and support the construction \\nmanagement to master the increasing challenges? \\nTo answer this question it is essential to real ize the role, the simulatio n can play within the \\nwhole construction management framework. The upper part of Fig. 1 shows that simulation \\nshould fulfill the demands of construction mana gement mentioned above. In the case that \\ninnovators within the construction firm - which are at best the us er of conventional management \\nmethods - assign simulation as a management method and use it consequently to support the \\ndecision making process, construction manageme nt is supposed to ex perience a systematic \\nchange as a result for this innovation. The reas on is that simulation in turn demands more \\nsystematic and transparency from constr uction management. Furthermore the figure Figure 1. Support of the management by simulation.

With th e functions of visualizing and dynamic modeling \\nsimulation can improve structuring construction projects and support cybernetic in the system. \\nMoreover, risks can be better estimated with th e help of simulation becau se of its ability to \\npredict future work progress. The consequences of a decision can not only be predicted but also \\nquantified by simulation, so that variant decision s can be better compared. The role of simulation \\nin management systems is accordingly exposed to have an intersection function among construction management systems. Therefore the potential of simulation does better than just \\nsupporting an individual planning process to beco me a common planning as well as controlling \\nmethod for construction management and a communi cation instrument for all involved parties.  \\nThe innovation planning matrix \\nThe innovation planning matrix is developed to help depicting the pote ntial of simulation to \\nbe used in construction management. This matr ix defines many factor categories for different \\napplication fields. Evaluating these categories for a possible application field leads to take into consideration probable structural changes, or even innovations, in construction operations, such \\nas outsourcing, specializing etc. Thus technical and organizational demands can be efficiently \\ndefined for simulation technique to be used in c onstruction sites and to suit the requirements of \\npractitioners. The categories can simply be clar ified by answering five essential “W-questions” \\nfor each possible application field: \\n- “Who-question”: intensive observa tion of the application field leads to identify the best \\nuser, who is supposed to prom ote simulation implementation. \\n- “Which-question”: a more detailed observation can define the process of interest for the \\nsimulation within a specific application field. \\n- “When-question”: after answer ing the two previous questio ns the phase in which the \\nsimulation can be economically implemented has to be determined.  \\n- “Why-question”: making the objectives of simula tion explicitly clear is one of the main \\ntasks in this context. \\n- “What-question”: also describing the benefits of simulation in this specified use case are \\nessential, especially to anim ate the user to use simulation. \\nThe “5W-Matrix”, i.e. innovation planning matrix, is generated af ter selecting a specific field \\nof application. It also helps deri ving new application fiel ds, like the Fig. 2 shows. Originally the \\nsupposed application field was ‘pla nning of earthwork in road c onstruction’. After dealing with \\nthe “5W-Matrix”, a specific and for the practice even more intere sting application field could be \\nidentified, i.e. “claim management in earthwork”. With this perception according to the related application field simulation has more innovation potential as a tool to enhance the analysis \\nprocess in resolving disputes  caused by changed conditions. \\nFurthermore an intensive study of a possible ap plication field should tr ace other innovations \\nthat can be efficiently integrated with simulation and thus function as a ‘driving spin’ to help it \\nachieving an innovation per se. The following is d ealing with this point with reference to the \\napplication field ‘logistics in  construction management’.  \\nApplication field: Construction Logistics  \\nIn this context an interesting innovation can be observed in the application field ‘logistics in \\nconstruction management’ that is the offered ‘constructi on logistics service’ of few specialized \\nGerman firms.

This firm was \\nengaged by a general contractor to coordina te construction waste di sposal. All concerned \\nsubcontractors should sign a contract to cooperate  with this logistics firm. The progress of \\nlogistics processes on the cons truction site was controlled by a logistics coordinator from the \\nfirm itself. More over the construction logistics fi rm utilized its patented mobile container system \\n“rolco”® and one forklift truck. These wheeled contai ners have also stirrups to be easily picked \\nup by a forklift truck. All subcontr actors were ordered to throw construction waste into these \\ncontainers, separated into differe nt fractions. They also had to move these containers to a \\ndetermined central place near the entrance of th e building, ready to be picked up by the forklift \\ntruck and uploaded into central  waste-containers. Furthermor e all deliveries, ordered by \\nsubcontractors, must be declared to the logistic s coordinator. This information flow enables him \\nto coordinate deliveries to construction site. These both logistics services insure a better \\ncoordination performance and improve the safety at work.  \\nSuch an innovative development represents a gr eat chance for simulation to be intensively \\nused in the practice and perhaps become an i nnovation. The discussed use case demonstrates the \\nbenefits of applying the “5W-Matr ix” to plan such an innovative use of simulation in another \\nexemplary use case in the same application field. \\nThe main scope of the following use case - and in  the same time the answer of the “Which” \\nand “When” questions - is logi stics coordination of interior works in high building projects. \\nMany subcontractors are usually involved in fini shing a building project.

One important service is to \\norganize the material flow to a nd within the construction site which is the subject of the specific \\nuse case below. This problem can be identified  as an answer of the “Why” question. “What” \\nbenefits simulation can offer to solve this probl em, should be represented by a special system to \\nimprove the decision making process. The develope d matrix shows the advantages of developing \\na special purpose simulation system to analyse ma terial transport to and within a construction \\nsite. Both technical and organisational demands on this simulation system should be the results \\nof intensive communication with the potential user identified by the “5W-Matrix”, i.e. the \\nlogistics coordinator.  \\nUse Case: Material flow in building projects  \\nThis use case covers two logistics tasks relate d to interior works of high building projects \\nwhich are the coordination of materi al deliveries to the site and th eir transport to the right floor \\nby elevators. It demonstrates how simulation can improve scheduling material deliveries \\nachieving economical utilization of available re sources. The modelled build ing project consists \\nof 30 floors. A snapshot situation shows that 6 di fferent works are being carried out at once, each \\nparalleled in 5 floors. These are bottom up:  floor, ceiling, wall, tiles, air conditioning and \\nelectrical works, respectively. Ma terials are delivered by trucks to the site, whereas one truck for \\neach work is supposed to come during the simula tion time. There are two standard lifts and one \\ngoods lift in the high building that can be used to convey delivered materials to where they have \\nto be installed. A forklift truck is  used to transport materials from  truck into lift directly, because \\nthe spatial conditions ne arby the unload place and the lifts do not allow any puffer places.  \\nTwo assumptions were met in order to simplif y the modelling effort: the delivered materials \\ncome in standardized containers; we call it transp ort units (TU), so that two TU go in standard \\nlift and three in goods lift. The second assumption is related to the decomposition of the building \\nproject; we assume that it contains of 6 secti ons, 5 floors and one work each. That is why the \\ntransport time to each section is modelled stochastically.  \\nSimulation represents an excellent method to an alyse productivities and waiting time of each \\nresource to choose the most economical alterna tive. This alternative should determine the \\nnumber of lifts to be utilized and schedule th e delivery time of each truck. A proto type \\ninstrument is developed to simulate the situ ation described above, with which also a free \\nparameterization of the resources is possible. This makes it easily usable for other building \\nprojects. The model is done with the help of a Petri nets based simulation system and described \\nlater on.

The history of Petri nets st arted 1962 with the dissertation thesis of Carl Adam Petri \\n(Petri 1962). With these nets complex processes can  be statically and dynamically ana-lysed. The \\nbasic net theoretical model was also proposed by Petri as condition/event systems. Since then the \\ntheory of Petri nets was continuously developed. In  general a Petri net consists of three elements \\nthat model the statistical state of a system. A place - denoted by a circle – represents a condition, \\nsuch as resource availab ility, buffer, input or output data. A transition – denoted by a solid bar – \\nrepresents an event or activity. The third element,  a directed and at-tributed arc, connects a place \\nwith a transition and vice versa. The dynamic st ate of the system is represented by tokens – \\ndenoted by a small solid circle – which are initiali zed at places and usually model the entities or \\nthe flow units of a system, such ma terial, resource, vehicle, etc.  \\nHigh level predicate/transition Petri nets (PrT) enable defining individual tokens with \\nchanging properties (Genrich, Lautenbach 1981). This enhancement allows the modeller to \\ndefine different types of tokens by assigning more  attributes to each type. To manipulate these \\nattributes during the simulation alphanumeric code can be integrated in transitions and executed \\nwhen they are activated (fired), Fig.3.

This paper reports on the preliminary findings of th is ongoing research.  Both the \\nU.S. and Japanese economies are high-tech intensive and both cultures have embraced technology.  However, a relatively small sector of the constructi on industry in each country has \\nimplemented WPMS.   This research seeks to  broaden our understand ing of implementation \\nbarriers that are limiting the use of WPMS tool s as well as means and methods of overcoming \\nthose barriers based on successful implementation in both countries.     \\nIntroduction \\nIn November 1999, 60 top executives from major engineering and software companies met in \\nChicago at CounterEntropy Strategi es’ Summit on Software.  The firms agreed that “the Internet \\nwill change how engineering software is used by facilitating collaborative efforts involving large \\nnumbers of people.”  Additionally, they forecas ted that “project Web sites will proliferate \\nrapidly, that e-commerce will come to dominate a ll aspects of sales and marking in architecture, \\nengineering, and construction i ndustry, that the computer interf ace needs a major overhaul, and \\nthat application servers will gr ow and spread quickly.”  (ASCE, 2000)  Has the industry yet \\nrealized this prediction?    During the dot-com bubble, innovators’ enthusiasm  swept the investor economy.  High-tech \\nproducts captured the nation’s imagination, and the construction industr y, (“industry”) was not \\nimmune; indeed, at the turn of the millennium , many observed that the use of WPMS and e-\\nCommerce applications was on the rise (Anumba and Ruikar, 2002, O’Brien, 2000, ASCE, \\n2000).  WPMS and e-Commerce start up compan ies emerged and attempted to establish \\nthemselves as the leaders in the industry (Kraker, 2000).  Ho wever, by mid 2002 many of these \\nstartups had closed their e-doors, merged with larger firms, or transformed themselves to serve \\nniche markets.  (Laiserin, 2002; Sawyer, 2004)    \\nCurrent State of the Industry \\nIt is clear why the industry once hailed this  new technology as a revolution (ASCE, 2000).  \\nThose who have studied this area agree that th ere is a need to repl ace redundant paper-based ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Give n this potential, how many companies in the \\nconstruction industry are currently using WPMS?  \\nUnited States \\nIn June, 2005 ENR reported on the results of an A/E/C survey sponsored by Adobe Systems Inc., \\nSan Jose, California (a technology vendor), and c onducted by Harris Inter active of Rochester, \\nNew York.  The Document Exchange Study in cluded survey results from November, 2004.  \\nThere were 965 architects, engineer s, contractors, owners, operators  or facilities managers who \\ndid not know the sponsor of the study at the time they responded to the 15-minute internet \\nsurvey.  When asked the means of document and information exchange with project team \\nmembers outside of their own firm, only 17% of  the respondents listed WPMS as a means of \\nexchanging data.

Of this 17 percent, 5.7 percent \\nare using in-house or custom-built project coll aboration software, while 12.2 percent are using \\ncommercial products.  While many firms have reported great savings using WPSM, there still seems to be  reluctance in \\nthe construction industry to uti lize this technology.  In Nove mber 2004, ENR reported that owner \\norganizations realize the efficiency gains from  WPMS; it is also reported that owners find ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

(Tulacz and Rubin, \\n2004)    This owner-driven adoption of WPMS was echoed by ConstructWare, (one of the most widely \\nused web-based project manageme nt tools available today).  C onstructWare reports that their \\ncurrent market focus is on owners.  Having st arted in 1994, and having had a presence on the \\ninternet since 1997, ConstructWare has found that contractors are reluctant adopters of this \\ntechnology; in contrast, it has f ound that the owners seem to immedi ately perceive the value that \\nWPMS offers by streamlining communication be tween project particip ants, and by enabling \\nanyone on the project team to view project documents and status from their office.  \\nConsequently, ConstructWare clients who are ow ners have started to specify the use of \\nConstructWare in the specifications  for their projects (Spadoni, 2006). \\n \\nJapan \\nAdoption of WPMS in Japan appears to be partly  driven by government policy and practice.  As \\na strategy to recover from long-term recession, the Japanese government and those in industry \\nhave identified information technology (IT) as  a way to make conventional systems more \\nefficient. (Pena-Mora & Tanaka 2002).  This dr ive for efficiency and globalization in business \\nencourages IT innovation in all Japanese indus tries including construction.  The Japanese \\ngovernment developed an IT policy in the 1990s with the goal of constructing systems for e-\\ncommerce and e-government in all sectors of the economy.  Concurrently, in the U.S., the \\nDepartment of Defense developed a procurem ent system called Continuous Acquisition and \\nLife-cycle Support, or CALS. European and Japa nese industries then adopted CALS as a means \\nof creating more efficient and effective business transactions. In Japan, the concept of Electric \\nCommerce was added to CALS, and the system is  presently called CALS/EC. (Takasaki et al \\n2002, DoD 1997) \\n In 1994, the Japanese government established th e “Government Information Promotion Plan” as \\na policy.  The government’s Ministry of Construction adopted “Construction CALS/EC \\nMaintenance Basic Framework” in 1996 with a goa l of applying this framework to all public \\nworks projects by 2010.  Furthermore, in 1997, the Ministry of Construction mandated that all \\nMinistry projects must use Construction CA LS/EC by 2004.  Based on this government policy, \\nConstruction CALS/EC has been developed and integrated into the Japanese construction \\nindustry. Construction CALS/EC includes e-pr ocurement, e-bidding, and collaboration \\nfunctionality for the design and construc tion phases of a project (JACIC 2005).  \\n Pena-Mora & Tanaka (2002) describe the nature of Japanese general c ontractors in their study. \\nAccording to the paper, the top five Japanese  general contractors, so-called Super General \\nContractors, have over 1,000 architects and engineers on staff. Generally speaking, large \\nJapanese general contractors te nd to provide not only constructi on services but also the design \\naspects of projects.  Just as some vertically integrated U.S. companies, these Super General \\nContractors can offer a diverse se t of services, and an owner can  hire one construction company \\nto design and build a project.

JACIC (2004) reported that \\n42% of large Japanese companies (over 1,000 employees) are using Application Service \\nProviders (ASPs) that offer WPMS; by comparisi on, less than 10 % of all Japanese companies \\nare using these systems.  Furthermore, JACIC ( 2005) reports that large ge neral contractors have \\ndeveloped in-house systems and ar e developing WPMS to share project information with other \\nstakeholders (JACIC 2005). However, smaller firm s in the industry have not yet adopted this \\ntechnology.      \\nBarriers to Implementation  in the U.S. and Japan \\nMany in the construction industry envision seamless data sharing networks with virtual teams \\nworking together from around the globe (B randon, 2005).  In studying responses to new \\ntechnology, Moore (2002) identifie s three types of people with  very different reactions: \\nInnovators  celebrate change, ar e enthusiastic users of new tec hnology, set the trends, and define \\nnew systems and processes that in corporate the new technology.   Pragmatists  are more wary of \\nchange, but are open-minded users of proven technology, will follow trends established by \\nothers, and incorporate new technol ogy into their work processes only after it has been proven to \\nhave a positive effect on the bottom line.  Skeptics  resist change on principle, will not accept \\ntechnologies even when proven, and go out of thei r way to avoid new systems or processes while \\nstubbornly continuing to work the old way.  (Moore, 2002)  Conseque ntly, it is not surprising to \\nfind that team attitudes towards the WPMS systems are one of the top success or failure factors for implementing web-based project management systems (Nitithamyong and Skibniewski, 2006).

These include: \\n \\n1) Most systems currently used by Japanese construction companies are based on \\nAmerican off-the-shelf software and are not  customized for the Japanese construction \\nindustry. \\n2) An element of Japan’s conven tional characteristic culture (ambiguity) does not fit the \\nnature of IT systems, which creat e transparency and inclusiveness. \\n3) Poor skills of users for IT system \\n4) Different representation/indicat ions of project information, such as schedule chart, \\nbetween the Japanese and the American style \\n Paul Spadoni of ConstructWare agreed that in his experience the barr iers listed by Takamoto, \\nwith the exception of language, representation and cultural issues, are applicable to U.S. \\ncompanies as well.

Make the implementation an IT priority \\n6. Define a ramp-up period \\n7. Insure effective training \\n  \\nPreliminary Findings \\nBased on the research to date, it seems that th ere are three main categories that need to be \\naddressed when implementing web-based collaborati on systems:  People, Program, and Process.   \\n \\nPeople :  For successful implementation, there needs to be support from upper management and \\nthe leaders of the primary user organizations.  Owners are particularly instrumental in \\nchampioning the utilization of these systems.  Howe ver, it is also imperative that project team \\nlevel champions also be cultivated  to use the system and integrate it into their daily work lives.   \\n Program : From a user interface and customer servi ce perspective, the software and hardware \\ntools have to be easy to implement.  It has been observed that if the pr oject team members do not \\nfeel comfortable using the system  within 4 hours, they will aba ndon the software to revert back \\nto the old way of doing things (Spadoni, 2006). Th e technology also has to be reliable.  If the \\ninternet connection is intermittent or the softwa re frequently crashes, users will abandon the \\nsystem for the older process that is more reliable .  The goal then is to make the new system the \\neasiest  way to get things done.  Why is change so di fficult?  People are like water:  they find the \\npath of least resistance.  With regards to we b-based project management systems, construction \\nengineering and managers have little time on the job to learn new systems or processes, and will \\ndefault to the easiest and fastest way to get the job done.  So the best way to implement \\ntechnology is to make it the easiest a nd fastest way to get things done.   \\n Process :  For successful implementation, the new tec hnology must be integrated into the daily \\nwork processes of the users.  If the software t ool becomes an add-on to existing processes, it will \\nbe the last on the list and infrequently utilized.  However, if the software tool is integral to the \\ndaily work processes of the management team, it will become instrumental.  In a recent case study at Polytechnic University in Brooklyn New York, the project team used ConstructWare for \\nRFIs, change documents, contract information, dr awings, and daily reports.  However, the web-\\nbased tool was not the first place the team we nt for information.  The project managers found \\nthat since the email was not integrated with the ConstructWare system, the project managers \\nwould open their email, answer and address ques tions, and not open ConstructWare.  If, on the \\nother hand, the email was incorporated into Cons tructWare, the users might open ConstructWare \\nfrom the start of their day and it could thus  become the information and communications hub. \\n(Griffis, 2006). \\n \\nFuture Research\\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

DAWOOD \\nSchool of Science and Technol ogy, University of Teesside \\nMiddlesbrough, Cleveland TS1 3BA, UK \\nn.n.dawood@tees.ac.uk \\n \\nABSTRACT \\n \\nRoad construction projects are characterised by  the use of heavy and expensive equipment and \\nmachinery. They are highly influenced by weathe r and geological risk factors, changes in \\nworking condition, environmental regulations and  other risk factors. Accuracy of construction \\nplanning in road projects is highly  dependent  on the experience of construction planners to \\nunderstand and incorporate risk factors. The prim e objective of this paper is to discuss the \\ncreation of a  knowledge-based/simulation system th at assist project manage rs to generate sound \\nconstruction schedules using know ledge and information which we re developed by extracting \\nconstruction and resources behaviour knowledge fr om 124 current and previous road projects. \\nKnowledge-base/simulation is an approach whic h can applied to model construction operations \\nand in particular at the construc tion planning stage. It can provi de the necessary information to \\nensure that resource allocatio n and construction methodology are a ppropriate  to obtain the best \\npossible project performance in terms of cost and time efficiency. The system is designed to \\nallow a thorough evaluation of all possible and feasible construc tion alternatives and provide \\nanalysis related to the compatibility between re sources used in different activities. The paper \\ndescribes briefly the respective features and capabi lities of the system a nd uses an international \\ncontract  as a case study to verify the system. \\n Keywords : Road construction, knowledge-based simulation, automation of planning. \\n \\n1. INTRODUCTION  \\n \\nAlmost all road construction planners use only th eir own experience and ‘gut’ felling to plan and \\nschedule road construction project and often use ‘subjective judgment’ to deal to uncertainty that \\ncharacterise road construction.  Th is approach has a very high marg in  of error,  time consuming \\nand hence increase the chance of risky and unsound plans. Whilst experience is important and crucial to make complicated planning decisi ons, a more systematic and knowledge-based DSS \\nsystems are needed to give planners tools and facilities to clearly de velop objective plans and \\nidentify and quantify the effect risk factors.   The use of knowledge-base/simulation as modelling tools and DDS systems have revealed to be \\nvery powerful  in designing complex constructi on operations [Kamat and Martinez (01)]. \\nSimulation has been utilised  as modelling tool s for automating construc tion planning processes \\nand assisting in the process of  selection of resources, determ ination of construction methods \\nwhich include construction cost and time.

A \\nknowledge-base/simulator DSS system (dubbed Road SIM) was developed to encapsulate such \\nknowledge and assist project planners to  develop sound road construction plans. \\n \\nThe next sections introduce simu lation techniques and the knowledge based approach used in the \\ndevelopment of RoadSim.  \\n2. SIMULATION MODELLING AND ROADSIM \\n \\nThe degree of complications and uncertainties associated with road construction made the \\napplication of current simulation tools (researc h and commercial) not practical. Frequent and \\nunpredictable changes in construction working conditions can introduce a high degree of uncertainty that cannot be adequately modelle d and predicted  by  ex isting simulation tools \\ndeveloped for construction purposes. These tool s are, in many cases, implementations of \\nCYCLONE developed by [Halpin (1976)] for the simulati on modelling of construction \\noperations. CYCLONE stands for CYCLic Operati ons NEtwork and, as suggested by the name, \\nis purely network based. Many CYCLONE-based simulation systems have been developed, \\ndeserving special mention INSIGHT [Pauls on 1978], UM-CYCLONE [I oannou (1989)], Micro-\\nCYCLONE [Halpin ( 1990)] and DISCO [Huang and Halpin ( 1994)]. These tools revealed to be \\nadequate for certain types of constructions, na mely concrete batching plant operations [Woods \\nand Harris (1980), Lluch and Halpin (1982)] or tunnelling [Touran and Asai (1987)]. RESQUE \\n[Chang (1986)] recognises the differences between resources and constitutes an important implementation of CYCLONE. COOPS [Liu (1991) ] was designed in an  object oriented \\nlanguage and builds the simulation by picking the construction objects from a library and placing \\nthem directly on the screen. CIPROS [Odeh (1992)] uses hierarchic al object oriented \\nrepresentation of the resour ces and combines both process level and project level. \\nSTROBOSCOPE [Martinez (1996)] provides access to the state of the simulation process. \\nThe main elements that underpin the above menti oned simulation models are the theoretical rules \\nthat drive the simulation engine. Such rules need s to be more practical  and knowledge based if \\nroad construction activities can be m odelled effectively and efficiently.  \\nThe rules should therefore be acquired from experi enced planners and  analysis of current and \\nhistorical real proj ects case studies.  \\nBased on a through review of existing simulation system, the research concluded that existing \\nsimulation systems are not capab le to efficiently and effectively model  the uncertainty \\nassociated with  road construc tion and are unable to represent accurately the road construction \\nproject.   In response to the i ndustrial needs of a more robust and practical DSS to assist planners \\nto develop sound construction plans, RoadSim wa s developed and presented in this paper.  \\nRoadSim is a knowledge-based system that incorpor ates expert rules of th e road construction. As \\nwidely recognised, the incorporat ion of expert rules allows be tter error detection, provides a \\nnatural framework for the simulation and treats adequately the tedious tasks related with the \\nmodelling process. The introduction  into the system of a speci fic set of realistic working \\nconditions provides a more reliabl e prediction of the behaviour of  the construction system, since \\nthe solutions have been previously studied and ve rified. This system uses the concept of “atomic \\nmodel” in order to simplify the modelling build ing and allow the introd uction of modularity in \\nthe process. The concept of “atomic model” was introduced by [Ziegler  (1987)] and developed \\nby [Luna (1992)] and [Odeh (1992)].  The following section deals with the knowledge base part of the system.

ROADSIM DEVELOPMENT: KNOWLEDGE BASED APPROACH \\n \\nThe development of RoadSim followed the steps indi cated in fig.1. The  thre e stages indicated in \\nthe figure form the knowledge-based part of th e system and are discussed in this section. \\n Stage1:   At this stage, a data collection proce ss was undertaken involving 124 road construction \\nprojects [Castro (2002)].  The data included Bo Q, method statements, resources involved, cost, \\ntime for each activity and site diar ies and accounts. The analysis of the data identified  (50) \\ncommon construction operations that usually form  the main part of any road project, their \\npossible execution methods and respective resources . Resources’ behaviour  and analysis were  \\nidentified and detailed. This in cluded technical information about  heavy machinery, performance \\nunder different weather and othe r risk factors and basic produc tion rates. The key road \\nconstruction materials were id entified, grouped and characterise d. The same process was used \\nfor labour.   Stage 2:   The evaluation of the construction perfo rmances constitutes stage 2 of the knowledge \\ndevelopment process. For each construction operation, all possible combination groups of \\nresources (equipment, materials and labour) were defined and thei r average production rate was \\ndetermined using equipment manufacturer’s info rmation and mainly the experience of road \\nconstruction managers who participated in the knowledge elicitation pro cess. The changes in \\nworking conditions, and the constraints related with the interactions between/among resources \\nhave also been analysed.  The same was done fo r other risk factors like weather, soil condition \\nand quality of heavy machinery a nd equipment drivers.  Efficien cy coefficients have been  \\nestablished to reflect the impacts of working c onditions and  job efficiency. The deliverables of \\nthis stage was a series of productivity equation that calculates productiv ities and costs under a \\nwide range of resource combin ations and project conditions. \\n Stage 3:  The third and final stage of the knowledge-based part of the system was constituted by \\nthe definition of the logical relationship betw een/among resources and between the resources and \\nexisting working conditions. The relationship be tween/among resources- especially equipment - \\nrefers to the interactions that are only conditi oned by the capability of the equipment units. The \\nproductivity of the defined combinations can be considered as the aggregation of the inherent \\ncharacteristics of the equipment unit and the interactions that are part of the construction operation and can be estimated through a mathematical  formula that was established at this stage \\nusing historical work performances.  These three  stages that consti tute the knowledge-based part of  the RoadSim which have been \\nused to define and populate  the RoadSim database.   The database  was populated with three different elements: \\n• The collection of work packages or construction operations identified in the road \\nconstruction analysis that resulted from the data collection process; \\n• The possible and feasible cons truction methods for the execu tion of activi ties with the \\ncorresponding combinations of equipment units; and ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

As the ship lines do not \\nfrequently serve these two ports, the port of  Durban (South Africa and 3000km) is commonly \\nutilised. In these circumstan ces, the selection of resources  should be optimised since \\ndemobilisations and/or mobilisations are very difficult and expensive. Possibilities of subcontracting and equipment hire are almost impossible and unattainable. The mobilisation \\noperation is logistically di fficult and should preferable be done once and involving all \\nequipment.

The system  \\nsimulates road construction operations by in tegrating knowledge-based approach  with \\nsimulation capabilities.  The paper presented a brief description of the Road Sim and focused on its ability to assist in the \\noptimisation of resources allocation. A case study of the use of RoadSim in an international contract concluded that RoadSim is a very important tools that  can assist planners in the \\nevaluation of the project performance, saving  time in the planning process, allowing the \\noptimisation of the resource a llocation and reducing costs.  \\n \\nREFERENCES  \\nCastro, S.

This is more so in industries with low profit \\nmargins such as the construction indust ry. In such industries, a systema tic approach fostering continuous \\nlearning, sharing and efficient diffusion of knowledge  is vital for a sustained and profitable business \\nperformance. Much research has been conducted to evaluate the benefits of knowledge management \\nsystems. This research differs in the fact that it re gisters the industry’s perspective on the worthiness of \\nknowledge management systems in practice.  This paper presents findings of a postal survey of contractors, c onsultants and quantity surveyors \\noperating within the UK constructi on industry to ascertain the exte nt of adoption and effective \\nimplementation of formal knowledge ma nagement systems. The purpose of the survey is to investigate \\nthe benefits of implementing such systems within project-based organisations. It also examines potential \\nobstacles hindering effective implementation and maintenance of such systems. Only 20% of the companies surveyed have a formal knowledge manageme nt system in place. The vast majority, 80% of \\nrespondents don’t have such systems. \\n \\nKeywords: Knowledge management, factors ranking, severity index \\n \\n \\nIntroduction\\n \\n The view that knowledge is a valuable organisa tional resource has become widely recognised and \\naccepted in the business community. Although it is difficult to quantify and value knowledge, it is \\nrecognised as one of the most important organisati onal assets. Schwandt and Marquardt [2000] argue that \\nknowledge has become the most important asset for orga nisations even more so than financial resources, \\nmarket position, technology, or any other company asset . They believe that knowledge is the core of an \\norganisation’s existence. Everything that an organi sation stands for, does, utilises, produces and provides \\nis essentially based on knowledge. This has led to th eir strong belief that knowledge is what conveys a \\ncompetitive edge in the marketplace.  As a result managing knowledge has become a critical  factor to business success and indeed survival \\n[Davenport and Prusak, 2000]. This is more so in in dustries with low profit margin which operate in an \\nincreasingly knowledge-driven economy. In such indust ries, continuous learning, knowledge sharing and \\nefficient transfer of knowledge in a structured a nd systematic manner is vital for a sustained and \\nprofitable business performance.

A num ber of researchers have also \\nlooked at the concept of knowledge management a nd its implementation in the construction industry \\n[AlGhassani, et. al. 2002, Elhag, et. al. 2003, Egbu , 2004]. This paper focuses on the perceived benefits \\nand obstacles of implementing knowledge manage ment systems in UK construction organisations. \\n \\nKnowledge management tools (techniques – technologies)  \\n \\nThe concept of knowledge management tools is one that  is very broad and tric ky to define. This is \\nbecause tools such as computers, phones, paper a nd pen can be useful in facilitating knowledge. \\nGenerally, KM tools have been grouped into two main categories: technologies which are IT based tools and techniques which are non-IT based [AlGhassani et . al., 2002]. Some of these are useful in enabling \\npeople within organisations to transfer knowledge, such as phones, while others are designed to capture, \\nstore and distribute it such as knowledge repositories.  The difference between techniques and technologies was well explained by Egbu [2004]. Knowledge \\nmanagement tools may have very diffe rent functions depending on the c ontext within which they are used \\n[Despres and Chauvel, 2000]. This was further highlig hted by Elhag et.al. [2002] who classified IT-based \\ntools according to various needs at different stag es of the knowledge management process. Egbu [2004] \\nsuggested some points which organisations should co nsider when selecting appropriate tools: clear \\nidentification of needs, awareness of available technologies and having an understanding of their \\nfunctional capabilities, and the na ture and location of knowledge. \\n \\nIn this study, techniques and technologies identified in the literature as suitable for capturing, storing and \\ndistributing knowledge are investigated. These incl ude on the one hand, human-based techniques such as \\nbrainstorming, post project review meetings, and face-to-face sharing of knowledge and on the other \\nhand, technologies such as case-based reasoning, groupw are software and the use of intranet/internet. \\n \\nThe construction organisations surveyed in this study were presented with a list of 16 knowledge \\nmanagement tools to identify those that are most likely to be used in these organisations. The following \\nsection presents the analysis and discussion on the findings of the study.  \\nThe Study\\n \\n This study is based on a postal questionnaire survey distributed to three different types of construction \\norganisations operating within the UK construction indus try: contractors; engineering consultants; and \\nquantity surveyors. A total of 200 companies were  contacted and 48 responses were received with a \\nresponse rate of 24%.  \\nThe questionnaire was designed to provide three categor ies of information. The first section concentrated \\non gathering information on the general background of  the company including the type of projects the \\ncompany was engaged in, the size of the organisati on measured by the annual turnover and the number of \\nemployees, and the level of experience of the respondent measured by the number of years in practice.  The second part of the questionnaire was subdivided in to two sections. The first was designed to gather \\ninformation on the processes, techniques and tools used  by the company to obtain and manage knowledge \\nwhilst the second section focused on the perceived be nefits and obstacles of knowledge management \\nsystems.

The \\nsize of organisations participating in the survey in  terms of turnover and number of employees is shown \\nin Table 1 below.  \\nTable 1: Size of Organisation \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  Knowledge management within the organisation - processes, techniques and tools\\n \\n \\nThe companies surveyed were request ed to indicate whether they impl ement a KM system within their \\npractices. The majority of respondents did not have at the time a formal KM system in place. These accounted for 80% of the respondents. The remaining 20% who did have a system in place also confirmed they had between 1 and 4 people employed specifically to  manage it. In addition, half of these companies \\n[with a KM system] also employed a knowledge management consultant.  \\n Respondents were asked to indicate whether their r espective organisations employed a systematised \\nprocess of learning from experience. For those companies who had a KM system in place, 67% confirmed the existence of a systematic learning process. The su rvey also revealed that almost 63% of companies \\nwith no KM systems learn from experience using a systematic process. \\n The study also intended to understand the means by which knowledge is created  and controlled within \\nconstruction organisations. The survey included thr ee approaches to gathering knowledge which were \\npresented to respondents: top-down, bottom-up and middle-up-down techniques. The survey revealed that \\nthe majority of companies – 93% - use the middle- up-down model developed by  Nonaka and Takeuchi \\n[1995]. Only 7% of the respondents indicated the use of the top-down approach. All of these were \\nrespondents in companies that did not have a formal knowledge management system in place. No respondent indicated the use of the bottom-up method in  creating knowledge and filtering that through the \\norganisations.  \\nAnother question in this section of the survey ai med to understand the learning processes and critical \\nlearning milestones for construction companies. The question whether learning reviews took place in the companies and at what stage in a project’s life was addressed. Respondents were as ked to rank in terms of \\nimportance four stages on a 5-point likert scale. Four learning milestones were presented: before a project starts, during the life of a project, before a key professional retires from a project and after a project is completed.

During the life of a project, about 58% of respondents agreed on the importance of undertaking learning reviews. The most worrying statistics is concerned with conducting a \\nlearning review before a key professional retires from a project. About 54% of respondents did not find it \\nimportant to conduct a learning review at this point. Th e implication of this issue will be discussed in the \\nfollowing paragraph. Finally, only 29% of responde nts indicated the significance of undertaking a \\nlearning review after the completion of a project.  The results demonstrated that a large number of th e companies surveyed 54% do not see the significance \\nof undertaking a learning review before a key professional or team member leaves a project or the \\norganisation as a whole. Indeed, only 30% indicated that  this process is significant. The reality is that \\nmuch of organisational knowledge is lost through re tirement, abandonment, restructuring and/or lack of \\nemployee commitment. This is particularly so with tacit knowledge which ultimately lead to the reduction \\nof the organisation’s competitiveness. As Schwandt  and Marquardt (2000) point out, organisational \\nlearning is critical to the survival of an organisation in the 21\\nst century. \\n The final question in this section aimed to identify the tools used in the learning process as well as in \\nsharing and transferring knowledge within construction companies. A list of 16 tools identified from the \\nliterature survey was presented to the respondents. Th ey were then asked to indicate the significance of \\neach of these on a 5-point likert scale. These responses  were then converted into percentages and a \\nSeverity Index was calculated for each factor. The seve rity indices were then used to rank the factors in \\nterms of importance.

This is followed by ‘training’ and ‘work teams/groups’. Results also \\nshowed that more formalised tools such as ‘knowle dge mapping’ and ‘recruitment’ do not feature high in \\nthe ranking. \\n \\nFace-to-face sharing of knowledge could take place in  a number of different settings. Formal meetings, \\nworkshops and seminars are the most popular means. These are often conducted under formalised \\nconditions. However, companies should also recognise the value of informal face-to-face meetings as \\neffective channels for knowledge creation, tran sfer and innovation diffusion (Larsen and Ballal 2005). \\nAlthough the term ‘knowledge management’ implies a sy stematic, structured and formalised creation and \\ntransfer of knowledge, a good knowledge management system is also one which encourages spontaneous \\nunstructured knowledge transfer. Daven port and Prusak [2000] argued that this less formalised means of \\nknowledge transfer is vital to a company’s success. \\n \\nThe survey also revealed that more formal means of learning tools feature low in the ranking by \\nconstruction companies. This implied that respondent s appreciated that although formal tools such as \\ndocuments, databases, groupware and internet/intran et are necessary for learning and effective \\nmanagement of knowledge, by far hu man interaction is more importa nt in learning and knowledge \\ntransfer.  \\n \\nBenefits of the implementation of KMS  \\n \\nThe final part of the survey was concerned with th e benefits and obstacles associated with the use of \\nknowledge management systems as perceived by resp ondents.

According to Di xon [2000], many organisations that have been on \\nthe leading edge of knowledge management activities have demonstrated tremendous cost savings that \\ncan be achieved through knowledge sharing. For the companies participating in this questionnaire one \\nreason could be that the KM systems they use are un suitable for the kind of knowledge they handle. This \\nleads to the deduction that unless the transfer system is fit for the kind of knowledge and task in hand, it may end up being ineffective in managing knowledge.  \\nCompanies with no KM system in place ranked increased competitiveness, improved teamwork and \\nenhanced project success as the most important factor s. There is a clear lack of agreement between the \\ntwo groups surveyed regarding KM system benefits. It is believed that one reason for not implementing \\nsuch systems within construction companies is that the true benefit of these systems particularly related to \\ntheir contribution to achieving company objectives ar e not fully understood and realised.

Furthermore, these companies regarded unwillingness to share, corporate culture and time pressures as \\nthe most important obstacles for effective and e fficient implementation of knowledge management \\nsystems. \\n On the other hand, companies, which do not ha ve a KM system ranked increased competitiveness, \\nimproved teamwork and enhanced project success as the most significant advantages.

These may be \\nconsidered to fall within the three categories of: (a ) how to capture relevant project knowledge in a \\ntimely fashion; (b) how to store the captured knowledge in an easy to access manner; and (c) how to \\ndisseminate the knowledge captured to poten tial users in a convenient manner.   \\n This paper describes the development of a framew ork to capture construction project knowledge on a \\n‘live’ basis.  The framework comprises of three main components: (a) a we b-based Project Knowledge \\nFile that stores the project know ledge captured; (b) a Project Know ledge Manager who is responsible \\nfor managing the inputs and outputs of the Project Knowledge File; a nd (c) an Integrated Workflow \\nSystem that determines how the knowledge captured should be captured, valid ated and disseminated.  \\nThe advantage of the framework is that it encourag es organisations to systematically collate project \\nknowledge that can be exploite d by all team members.   \\n Keywords: construction project, kno wledge, capture, reuse, framework \\n \\nIntroduction \\n“Most activities or tasks are not one-time events. .. Our philosophy is fairly simple: Every time we do \\nsomething again, we should do it better than the last time ” (BP’s Group Chief Executive John Brown in \\nProkesch,1997)\\n.  Snider et al. (2002) also state “ though the idea of learning fr om experience is timeless, \\nformalized systems for capturi ng and disseminating lessons with in an organisation have received \\nincreased attention in recent years ”.  The construction industry has also recognised that although each \\nproject is unique, there are some pr ocesses that are repeatable and t hus there is scope  to capture and \\ntransfer knowledge from previous pr ojects.  This is vital to prevent the ‘re-invention of the wheel’ and \\nto avoid repetition of previous mistakes.  Howeve r, whilst companies recogni se that the capture and \\ndissemination of project knowledge is important, it appears to be a ‘hol y grail’ for many organisations \\nbecause of other commercial pressures that i nhibit the capture and dissemination of knowledge. \\n A challenge would be to capture proj ect knowledge as soon as it is recogni zed, i.e. in a ‘live’ context so \\nthat the impact of the event does no t diminish with time and also to maximize the potential reuse within \\nthe project lifecycle.  This paper therefore descri bes a research project aime d at capturing construction \\nproject knowledge in a ‘live’ format  that will enable re-use.  It uses  case studies determine the types of \\nknowledge considered important to capture and re-u se and typical user-requi rements and presents a \\nframework to capture construction project knowledge.  \\nImportance of Capturing Knowledge \\nThe imperative of ‘live’ capture of knowledge is supported by the recent su rvey of organisations \\ninvolved in PFI (Private Finance In itiative) projects where the ‘live’  capture of knowledge is noted as ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

(2002). They assert that a constr uction organisation’s only sustainable advantage li es in its capability \\nto learn faster than its competitors and the rate of change imposed by the external environment, and that \\nthere is a need to ‘integrate learning w ithin day-to-day work processes’. Kamara et al. (2003) have \\noutlined the potential benefits of ‘live’ capture and reuse of project knowledge as follows:  \\n• Facilitates the reuse of collectiv e learning on a project by individual firms and teams involved in its \\ndelivery. More insights are likely to  be captured in the collaborative  environment, as each of the \\nmembers in the project team knows  only bits of the whole story about the project (Kerth, 2000);  \\n• Provides knowledge that can be utilised at the operation and maintenance stages of the assets’ \\nlifecycle;  \\n• The ‘live’ methodology for knowledge capture  could involve the memb ers of the supply chain in a \\ncollaborative effort to capture learning in tandem with project implementation, irrespective of the \\ncontract type used to procure the project from th e basis of both ongoing and post-project evaluation;  \\n• Benefits the client organisations  with enriched knowledge about the development, construction and \\nmanagement of their assets; and  \\n• Benefits the construction industry as  a whole. Project team s would be enabled to manage better the \\nsubsequent phases of a project, to better plan futu re projects and to colla borate better with other \\norganisations through the capture an d transfer of learning from a previous phase or projects.  \\n• Prevents knowledge loss due to time lapse in capt uring the knowledge. This is supported by Linton’s \\n(1975) findings which reveal that th e percentage of human memory reta ined on a set of data depletes \\nover time and that the probability  of forgetting an event (and know ledge) increases as time elapses; \\n• Maximises the value of reusing th e knowledge captured th rough ‘live’ reuse. The true benefit of \\ncapturing knowledge comes only when the knowledge is being used (McGee, 2004), particularly if \\nthe knowledge is being reused ‘live’ after it has been captured.; and  \\n• Enables the knowledge to be disseminated for reus e as soon as possible (i.e. ‘live’) before the \\nopportunities for reusing the knowledge diminish. This helps to seize every knowledge reuse \\nopportunity.  \\n \\nTools for Capturing Project Knowledge \\nThe most common approach used in the industry to capture the learning from pr ojects is the post-project \\nevaluation (Orange et al. 1999). This is usually conduc ted individually by participating organizations to \\na project. Post project ev aluation can be useful in consolidating the learning of people involved in the \\nproject under review, but th ere are indications that  current practice does not provide an effective \\nframework for the capture and reus e of learning. A common pr oblem is that of insufficient time for \\npost-project evaluation to be conduc ted effectively (if conducted at a ll), as relevant personnel would \\nhave moved to other projects (Orange  et al, 1999). Furthermore, it does not allow the current project to \\nbe improved by incorporating the lessons being learnt  as the project progresse s. There is also the \\nproblem of loss of important information or insigh ts due to the time lapse in capturing the learning. \\nMoreover, in consolidating the learning of peopl e involved, post project ev aluation is a not very \\neffective mechanism for the transfer of knowledge to non-project participants. It is also limited in scope, \\nin that the perspective is that of members within  only one of the participat ing organizations to the \\nproject.  The reliance on people is based on the assumption that  the knowledge acquired fr om one project can be \\ntransferred by that individual when  s/he is reassigned to another project.

The use of framework agreements \\nalso cannot guarantee that th e learning of individual firms participa ting in the agreement is shared to \\nother participants for the benefit of the project, since these firms can be in competition elsewhere (e.g. \\non other projects) and may not want to divulge ‘secrets’ th at might weaken their competitive advantage. \\n A study conducted by Tan et. al (2005) indicated th at other popular tools us ed for capturing and \\ntransferring project knowl edge include groupware, communities of practice, expert directories. \\n \\nLimitations of Existing Practice \\nBusby (1999: 23) concluded that “p ost-project reviews were important learning mechanisms and their \\nvalue seems to be underestimated by individuals who do not appreciate the need to disseminate insights \\nthroughout the organization”.  Weiser and Morrison (1998) also noted that very few firms systematically \\nidentified, captured and transferred project information for future use.  They recognised the importance \\nof sound project management where explicit knowl edge in the form of drawings, standard, \\nspecifications, etc. are documented.  However, they stressed that there was a need to capture knowledge \\non tools and methods used and stressed the importan ce of lessons learned to outline precise problems, \\ndescribe successful and unsuccessful solutions, relevant people to contact, etc. The main problems with \\ncapturing project knowledge can be summa rized as follows Carrillo (2005):  \\nAd hoc Capture:  Whilst companies aim to capture and transfer project knowledge, this  tends to be done \\non an ad hoc basis with little or  no structure regarding which proj ects are examined and how the \\nknowledge is captured (Carrillo, 2005); Tick Box Mentality:   Some companies that attempt to capture knowledge appear to be doing this as part \\nof a quality a management exercise that is more in terested in ticking boxes, rather than the resulting \\nlearning processes \\nLack of Dissemination :  Even if project knowledge is capture d, one of the main weaknesses is the \\nstorage and dissemination of lessons  learned.  This stems from the lack of a structured way of \\ndisseminating the knowledge in a pro-active manner.  Thus these potentially useful snippets of \\nknowledge tend to reside, unused and buried in reports.  \\nThe CAPRIKON Project \\nIn order to overcome the limitations in current i ndustry practice regarding th e capture and reuse of \\nknowledge, it is necessary that project knowledge is captured while it is being executed , and presented \\nin a format that will facilitate its reuse during and after the project.   However, the ‘live’ capture and reuse of construction project knowle dge poses a number of questions: \\n1. What knowledge from a project is  reusable in other projects? \\n2. How can this knowledge be captured (during and af ter project implementati on) in a cost-effective \\nway, given the temporary nature of constructi on projects, and given the various facets (e.g. \\norganisational, human and technology i ssues) that need to  be considered? \\n3. How can project knowledge be captured without causing unnecessary knowledge overload for \\nproject participants who already have to cope  with huge amounts of project information? \\n4.

Focus was on the concepts of “collaborative learni ng” (Digenti, 1999) since \\nthe intention was to involve members of the supply chain in the live capture of project knowledge. The \\nconcept of “learning histories” (K leiner and Roth, 1996), which was de veloped to capture and transfer \\nuseful knowledge from one team to another team opera ting in a different contex t, was also explored.  \\nBoth these concepts provided insights on the live capture of project knowledge. For example, \\ncollaborative learning is best f acilitated by clear guidance, safegua rds and opportunities for mutual \\nbenefits for members of the supply chain who are requested to contribut e their learning.  The idea of \\nsoliciting multiple perspectives of a learning event (a s advocated in learning history) to build a holistic \\npicture of the learning that took place , was also found to be helpful as this corresponds to  the reality in \\nconstruction projects which require the exper tise of the supply chai n for their success. \\nVarious web-based and related t echnologies, such as ASP.NET, PHP and data mining were also \\ninvestigated to ensure that the most appropriate solution could be found that will facilitate the live \\ncapture of project knowledge.  \\nDevelopment of the Methodology \\nThe methodology developed was embodied in a web- based application, CAPRI.NET. It focused \\non two interrelated problems: what learning is to be captured, and how it is captured, represented \\n(i.e. content and process ) and shared.

With this in mind, it makes sense that the \\nproject manager adopts the role of PKM. \\n \\nThe Project Knowledge File (PKF) is  validated by a group of designate d people before it can be shared \\nand reused.

Construction \\nprojects involve many interfaces wher e communication is essential for the production of high quality work. As \\nprofessionals recognize that they can gain new knowledge and reduce misunderstanding through communication, knowledge sharing is becoming ever more essential in the modern world. The main focus of \\nthis research is to explore the channels used to share knowledge in the contractor’s in-house team for Disney’s \\nAdventureland Project. The effectiveness of the knowledge sharing media is also evalua ted, and the facilitators \\nof and barriers to knowledge sharing are examined. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to achieve the objective of what knowledge is shared and how it is shar ed within a contracting team. Findings indicate that \\nthe thickness of the communication media is more important for diffusing personal and complex knowledge \\nthan general one. In this study, face-to-face communicati on is most valued by professionals over telephone or \\ne-mail for sharing complex and personal knowledge. The success of knowledge sharing in this project depends on the work environment, friendships and social networks. However, the lack of commitment of team members, diverse multi-disciplinary views and the cult ure of the organization are barriers to knowledge \\nsharing. \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\nThe construction industry in Hong Kong is highly fragmen ted as projects are broken down into many parts and \\ndistributed among many players. Communication among the various parties may become inefficient due to the presence of many tiers and specialisations. The sharing of experience , skills and knowledge between different \\nparticipants on a construction project team is essentia l in order to improve the performance of the project as \\nwell as to meet the project goals. Professionals can l earn from each other’s expertise or from past projects, and \\nthis can prevent them from making similar mistakes.  Construction project team members can share knowledge in both formal and informal ways. These include meetings, telephone calls, databases, intranets, e-mail, forums and documentation. Although technology \\nsupports knowledge sharing, the most  important factors are how team me mbers apply their knowledge and the \\nmotivation behind the sharing of knowledge. This re search examines the channe ls and effectiveness of \\nknowledge sharing in the contractor’s in-house team of the Adventureland project, which is part of Hong Kong \\nDisneyland. In addition, it explores the potential facilitators of and barriers to knowledge sharing in this \\nproject. The Adventureland project is chosen as a case study in this research as it is unique and complex, \\ninvolving diverse expertise: it is thus essential to  exercise knowledge sharing amongst the project team \\nmembers in order to achieve success.  \\nKnowledge Sharing \\n \\nKnowledge sharing is defined as team members mutu ally sharing their experi ences and ideas. Knowledge \\nsharing is not confined to large organizations only. It also occurs in small and medium-sized enterprises ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Fong (2003) recognizes that multidisciplinary project teams are essential in \\ncreating new knowledge, as they help to solve problems and disseminate knowledge.    \\nKnowledge-sharing channels includ e face-to-face meetings, and verb al and written communications. In \\naddition, people may use different types of meetings designed to promote the socialization of shared values and goals in order to enhance knowledge sharing (Hakanson, 1995). The frequency of applying different sharing channels depends on the types of knowledge being shared and who the senders are. Face-to-face \\ncommunication is especially suitable for complex knowledge. The more complex the knowledge, the greater \\nthe need for face-to-face inte raction, as complex knowledge is difficu lt to describe fully in writing (Daft & \\nLengel, 1986).    \\nE-mail and databases are good for transferring less complex knowledge such as rules, forms and procedures \\nthat can easily be written down (Daft & Lengel, 1986). In addition, the effectiveness of technology-assisted communication such as databases and e-mail depends  on speed and accuracy (Bakos & Treacy, 1986). \\nKelleher & Levene (2001) agree that knowledge can be shared through various technological systems such as computer databases and intranets.  Explicit knowledge can be shared verbally, while tacit knowledge can only \\nbe shared through socialization. Knowledge sharing is necessary to an organization’s success and thus has \\nbecome the focal point of strategy and the strategic pl anning process (Liebeskind, 1996). While many factors \\nare involved in sharing knowledge, one that is of pa rticular importance is media selection (Carlson & Davis, \\n1998).  Managers can improve performance by matching media characteristics to the needs of the organization \\n(Daft & Lengel, 1986).   \\n Knowledge sharing establishes a good managerial technique in organizations, enabling individuals on various levels to participate in the joint production (Kalling & Styhre, 2003). Managers must communicate the \\nimportance of knowledge sharing by both their verbal and nonverbal behaviour. Dent & Montague (2004) state \\nthat senior management was able to communicate the concept of knowledge sharing across teams by emphasizing its importance through workshops and forums. Managers must play an active role in developing an organization that will transfer knowledge, as they help define and implement the organizational culture \\n(Datta, 1991). Leaders should motivate their team member s to share knowledge. According to Matsui et al. \\n(1987), team members should develop a sense of shared  responsibility for the group goals. The success of \\nknowledge sharing depends on the commitment of the whole company instead of part of it.    Activities related to knowledge sharing depend heavily on the participation and motivation of the people \\ninvolved (Rajan et al., 1998). Knowledge sharing be comes more efficient with an open company culture \\n(Kelleher & Levene, 2001). A relaxed environment enhances knowledge sharing. Team members give more ideas in participative decision making (Yukl, 1998). Trust reduces the resistance to knowledge sharing. Coleman (1988) observed that knowledge sharing is succe ssful if a relationship of trust exists between the \\ncontributors and users of knowledge. Shafritz & Ott (2001) studied an organization that conducted weekly \\nMonday morning meetings. Although these meetings we re designed to share knowledge, team members failed \\nto voice their opinions as they were under the false im pression that they were supposed to agree with the \\ndiscussion and not offer a conflicting opinion.  Thus it is necessary for a company to establish knowledge \\nsharing as a cultural norm.  If the culture does not embrace continuous le arning, team members will not fully \\nunderstand the need for additional training and development (Wise, 1996) that could help in knowledge sharing.  Knowledge sharing depends on the ease of communication and the relationship between the source and \\nrecipient units. Close ties lead to a higher level of motivation to share more information, according to the \\nopinions of Cross et al. (2001). They explain that if  an organization wants to create relationships, it is \\nimportant to increase the opportunity for face-to-face interactions among people.   \\n \\nResearch Methodology \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

According to Scholz (2002), cas e studies are considered an  appropriate approach to \\nreal, complex, current problems that cannot be treated simply by one of the known analytical methods, such as \\nexperiment, proof, or survey.   \\n Interviews were conducted in order to yield a deeper understanding of the current situation of knowledge sharing in the Adventureland project. Every interview was conducted on a one-to-one basis in the form of an \\nin-depth discussion to collect information in order to meet the objective of the study. Ten face-to-face semi-\\nstructured interviews were conducted on site in December 2004, with interviews lasting from 30 to 90 minutes. The information collected was used to form a detailed picture of the topic area. The questions asked in the \\ninterviews could be classified into several types: a) background of the interviewee, b) effectiveness of \\nknowledge sharing, and c) facilitators of and barriers to knowledge sharing. All questions were of the open-\\nended type. The interviewees were encouraged to expre ss their opinions freely. In terviewees were carefully \\nchosen based on their positions and experience in the contractor’s firm. In addition, interviewees had to stay in the site office at least one full day during the week. This provided a more consistent result as they had a better \\nunderstanding of operat ion of the site office than those working exclusively off-s ite. Ten interviewees from \\ndifferent departments of the project team were deemed su fficient to reflect knowledge-s haring activities in the \\ncontractor’s team.  On-site observations were conducted by attending site meetings and also informally conversing with \\nAdventureland site personnel and listening to them telling each other site stories. Visual impressions were \\ngained by walking around the Adventureland construction site. Observations offer opportunities to validate the \\ninformation collected through interviews by comparing what people say and how they actually behave, thus minimizing the chance of misunderstanding and misinterpr etation. Document analysis was used as it provides \\nmore comprehensive data. Minutes and correspondence were  collected and analysed in order to interpret the \\ntypes of knowledge shared and the effectiveness of knowledge sharing in the Adventureland project. Through these documents, information about the history and background of the project, the legal and policy environment, the objectives and other issues related to the project was tracked. Answers from interviewees \\ncould be cross-checked by studying documents to see whether they were being honest or not. This allowed a \\nfull and real picture of knowledge sharing within the in-house project team being generated.  \\nResults \\n \\nThe main contractor, CW, was awarded the contract for the Adventureland project in 2003. Adventureland is \\nan escape into the remote jungles of Asia and Africa, and includes a jungle river cruise, two cafes, the “Lion King” theatre and “Tarzan’s Treehouse”. It is a huge  and complex project which involves many interfaces. \\nQuality requirements are extremely high. Nearly all ma terials are imported from overseas so as to satisfy the \\nclient’s requirements. To fu rther meet these requirements, some of the most experienced staff of CW have \\nbeen assembled to achieve the task, including a director assuming the duties of project manager, 6 project managers taking on the role of facilities agents, 7 depa rtment managers, and a supporting work force of around \\n130 members covering the structural, builder’s and E&M work. \\n \\nFrequency of using different sharing channels  The face-to-face meeting was the most mentioned knowledge-sharing channel. All interviewees spent about half a day meeting with other in-house team members ever y day. The main feature of this project was that the \\nproject team of contractors, client and sub-contractor s saw each other on site everyday, making it easier to call \\nmeetings. In addition, telephone communication was rated more popular than written communication on site.  There were two types of meetings: internal and external. Internal meetings were usually informal and \\nconducted within the contractor’s in-house team. There were generally three kinds of meetings: 1) meetings \\nbetween the PM and department heads every morning, 2) meetings among the contractor’s in-house team to solve problems and report its progress every Saturday afternoon. This was similar to the above meeting but ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The first two tend to be more formal than the last one. External meetings between the client and CW \\nwere formal, while those between CW and its sub-contractors were informal. In general, external meetings \\nwere more formal than internal meetings. There were usually more participants in external meetings than \\ninternal ones and more expatriates were involved.    Telephone conversation is one of the communication types which is used for less complex issues in this \\nproject. The results of the interviews indicate that the contractor’s in-house team usually used the telephone to \\nconfirm the times of meetings with th e client or sub-contractors. Moreover, CW used the telephone to confirm \\nwhether or not the receiver had received e-mails, faxe s and RFIs. In addition, CW’s in-house team on site \\nalways communicated with the head office by telephone. Apart from f ace-to-face and telephone \\ncommunication, the alternative approach was to use the written form. Based on the observations on site and \\nfrom analysing documents, it is evident that the written communication method was the least frequently used on site. There were generally 7 types of written communication.  Letters were more formal than memos, Requests for Interpretation  (RFI), Requests for Substitution  (RFS), e-mails, faxes, or databases. E-mail was \\nmainly used for external communication. Daft & Lengel (1984) pointed out that information of low complexity \\nwould be shared using e-mail. Interviewees confirmed that CW shared knowledge with the client on minor \\nissues via e-mail. This finding is consistent with those of Daft & Lengel (1984).  Effectiveness of knowledge sharing channels \\n \\nThe study revealed that the face-to-face meeting/discussion was the most effective sharing medium as suggested by interviewees: this is supported by Nonaka & Takeuchi (1995), who found that individuals share knowledge with each other effectively through fa ce-to-face dialogues. Face-to-face communication allows \\nimmediate feedback between the sender and the receiver. This feedback may be verbal or a signal, such as a \\nfacial expression showing frustration. Eye contact allows participants to monitor one another’s mutual perceptions. Body language and tone of voice can be observed too. This alleviates problems of misunderstanding since it allows for the immediate exchange of information. Goffman (1963) pointed out that \\neye contact maximizes the opportunity for participants to monitor one another’s mutual perceiving. This \\nreduces misunderstanding between sender and receiver. As  a result, all parties can get confirmation of common \\nunderstanding and agreement on what is being said. Problems can be solved easily and quickly. In addition, the effectiveness of communication media depends on the r eceiver’s perception and the nature of the knowledge \\nshared. It is important to choose the correct medi um for the kind of knowledge the team members are \\nattempting to share (Gnyawali et al., 1997).  \\n Informal meetings are more effective than formal mee tings according to the interviewees. Informal meetings \\nfacilitate knowledge sharing, as participants are mo re willing to express their ideas and problems can be \\nresolved more quickly. As pointed out by the building services manager, consultants discussed changes of \\nmaterials with the contractor. They reached a consensu s during a meeting, which shortened the time needed for \\napproval by the client. They immediately submitted shop drawings for the Buildings Department’s approval. It can be seen that better solutions could be reached as different views were integrated.  \\n \\nFace-to-face meeting was also the best way to share pe rsonal and complex knowledge.  Site meetings were \\norganized to ensure that the various design disciplines’ offices kept up with the necessary design coordination work in progress. According to site observation, CW and the client came across technical problems in \\nconstruction during a meeting. At first, no decision from the client was forthcoming. Due to time constraints, \\nCW suggested their own solutions to the client as the cl ient’s engineers were not present in the meeting. Once \\nthe client agreed with CW, problems were resolved quickly.  Some of the periodic site meetings were followed by site walks, where participants went out on site to discuss \\namong themselves the daily progress of the construction, and to review design compliance and appraise \\nworkmanship. In this project, the client and CW met on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. They then had site walks on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

During a meeting, CW clai med that they had finished the door installation but \\nthe client was not so sure. Proof of completion of the work could only be revealed on site. Both parties could evaluate for themselves, as seen on site, that the installation of doors had been finished.   \\n \\nInterviews also showed that site walks and meetings we re effective for problem solv ing for the contractor’s in-\\nhouse team. Site walks allowed direct communication between site agents and foremen. A closer relationship was maintained and knowledge of construction methods was shared more effectively. The area development \\nteam usually discussed construction problems on site. Each member had a better understanding of the practical \\nwork as it was clearly visible on site, as opposed to trying to foresee problems from oral description or drawings. It was easier for them to locate problems and solve them more efficiently.   \\nThe findings indicate that e-mail was the least effective method of communication in this project. The lack of \\nsignals in an e-mail leaves much ambiguity. People often misinterpret the information received through e-mail, \\nas the communicator cannot see the target’s reaction (Cramton, 1997). Some interviewees commented that e-\\nmail increased the workload of staff, as they needed to check it regularly. In addition, the sender needed to confirm whether the e-mail had reached the receiver or not.  Follow-up action such as a telephone call was \\nneeded in order not to miss the message, and this was time-consuming. However, e-mail is still in use as it can \\nremind staff to take action on some issue after telephone communication.  Facilitators of knowledge sharing  \\n \\nThe presence of knowledge sharing activities does not n ecessary mean that the knowledge sharing activities \\nare performed effectively. The effectiveness of knowledg e sharing activities is determined not only by media \\nselection, but also by several other factors. Thus, team members will not use knowledge sharing activities \\neffectively if the implementation factors do not encourage participation. From analysis of the interviews, work \\nenvironment, capability and personality of receivers and social relationships were the key determinants of the \\nsuccess of knowledge sharing in this project.    \\nA relaxed work environment is more effective than a forced one. Team members are more willing to share \\nknowledge and experience in a relaxed climate. Knowledge sharing is effective in an open culture with a high degree of trust and support at senior corporate levels  (Dent & Montague, 2004). As explained by the project \\nQS, they always held informal meetings with their ow n QS team in a relaxed environment. As team members \\nwere more open with one another, they even shared knowledge during lunch or in their leisure time through \\ngeneral conversation. From observations, team members dropped in and out, stepped behind the partitions, or \\nwalked over to the workstations of the Lion King Theatr e representatives in order to share their experience on \\nconstruction methods. Informal meetings can provide the type of relaxed work environment that might motivate individuals to express their views an d share their knowledge more readily.   \\n \\nThe responsibility and power of receivers are key to the success of knowledge sharing.  Hirokawa & Poole \\n(1996) considered the ability to communicate meaningfully to be one of the key factors that affected the extent \\nto which knowledge was shared among team members. The assistant planning manager explained that the role \\nof the receiver affected the effectiveness of knowledge sharing. If the receiver was the client’s QS, the issues \\ndiscussed would be contractual or financial issues. No consensus could be reached if technical construction problems were discussed, as the QS was not experi enced in this area. If the receiver was the client’s \\nconstruction director, then the issues of labour, strategy and general direction could be discussed in depth. It is \\nevident from interviews and observation that personality affected the volume of knowledge shared. The \\neffectiveness of channels of knowledge sharing de pends on personality, working style and a person’s \\npropensities. Individual characteristi cs such as being helpful, generous, courteous and reliable (McCrae & \\nCosta, 1987) and open to others’ experience affect knowledge sharing. The PM explained that a person who was more open shared more knowledge with others. They even shared knowledge when having lunch together, \\ntravelling back to the site office on buses or during af ter-work social events. By contrast, if the receiver was \\nclosed, less knowledge would be shared and it would be limited to work issues.

All the interviewees agreed that the better two \\npeople know each other, the more th ey share as trust is built up. There are fewer hidden problems, and \\nproblems can be better foreseen. This allows better planning for the future. Cross et al. (2001) found that \\nrelationships are critical for obtaining information, solving problems, and learning how to do your work. The \\nproject QS mentioned that some materials imported from the Chinese mainland were delivered by air in order to complete work on time. The QS needed to know th e reason behind this decisi on, as it was cheaper to \\ntransport materials by ship. Since the QS had a good working relationship with the project coordinator of the \\nsub-contractor, he could easily find out the reason which was delayed submission of the purchasing order by \\nthe sub-contractor. Friendships are definitely needed for the exchange of personal knowledge. Knowing the receiver’s expectations and methods of communication leads to the ability to predict and explain their actions. However, it is time-intensive. \\n \\nBarriers to Knowledge Sharing  People with different demographic backgrounds have different communication styles.  The motivation and commitment of a person to share know ledge are important. If the staff is more active, it is easier to share \\nknowledge. The contractor’s team needed to deal with different levels of people daily. The BS manager \\nmentioned that the sender needed to adjust to the receiver’s personality when sharing knowledge. It is difficult to change other people’s attitudes. He used an example to illustrate this point: in the case of a person who had 30 to 40 years’ experience in the construction industry, it was difficult to change his attitude to adapt to \\nadvanced technology. Even though databases are more environmentally friendly, he would not accept them as \\nhe believed keeping hard copies was safer and more secure. He claimed that information would be lost once a computer hard disk crashed.   \\nSharing knowledge with different experts may lead to conflicts, as they have different intentions. The project \\nQS and the site engineer from the Lion King Theatre agreed that conflicts arose easily due to people having different opinions and perceptions.  The operations department might object to commercial advice from the QS although it was essential for the project. In addition, not everyone was willing to give opinions, as they were \\nafraid that their ideas would be rejected by others.   \\n \\nConclusions  \\n \\nThe study revealed that knowledge sharing was fully applied in the Adventureland project, as it was highly \\ncomplex. The quality requirements of the client we re extremely high and involved interfaces with many \\ndifferent parties. The separation of design and construction and the lack of communication may have led to poor quality. Knowledge sharing was essential in this project in order to satisfy the client’s project \\nrequirements. \\n \\nThe findings illustrate that face-to -face communication was the most popular channel in this project. When the \\ncontractor’s in-house team came across any problems, they discussed them with the team and attempted to get a solution by formal or informal meetings. Site  walks were scheduled after meetings to reduce \\nmisunderstandings between parties. Written communication was the least popular method on site, as everyone \\ncould meet daily in any case. There was no need to wa ste time on drafting letters or e-mails. Likewise, sharing \\nchannels varied with the nature of knowledge shared  and types of receivers. Fo r more complex knowledge, \\nface-to-face communication was preferred. For less comp lex knowledge, telephone communication, e-mail or \\nmemos were preferred. \\n \\nThe success of knowledge sharing depends on the work environment, capability and personality of receivers and social relationships.  If these are appropriate, knowledge sharing will be more effective. A relaxed environment helps to build a good relationship between team members and makes them more willing to share \\ntheir opinions. Friendships positively influence effect iveness because friends have a greater ability to \\ncommunicate with each other than wi th non-friends. Social networks bui lt up in the project help with the \\nsharing of knowledge in the future.

This structure is endogenous by virtue of \\nenvironmental necessity that arises form the complexity of the undertakings and the \\nenvironmental turbulence. Furthermore, the asserti on: “Self-awareness is a prerequisite to self \\nactualization” was stated in order to emphasize the necessity for further study that will deepen \\nunderstanding of the nexus of strategy, structur e and performance as a potent instrument of \\namplification of performance. (Katsanis, 2004 ).  This paper builds on these concepts by \\npresenting first the underlying co ncepts of organization as a sy stem in the context of the \\ncomplexity of the AEC and then by exploring the use of the system concepts as viewed by \\nresearchers in other fields. Th is cross-boundary exploration rela ted to the AEC was previously \\nidentified in Katsanis (2005) and it re veals exciting and promising findings.  \\n  To explore the potential of cross-disciplinary knowledge de rived from the domain of \\nsystems theory, the AEC industry and its attributes are presented in the syst ems context. In this \\ncontext the interdependence of structure, strategy  and performance are examined in the light of \\nrelevant antecedents that bear on issues of perfor mance in AEC firms. Finally, a set of strategies \\nform settings other that the AEC Industry is presen ted and the performance of these strategies is \\nquantified and contrasted. An analogous set of strategies em ployed in the AEC are then \\njuxtaposed and their performance is assessed. This juxtaposition provides a platform for \\nexploring questions for future  research in this area.  \\n \\nThe AEC as a System \\n \\nIn order to appreciate the usef ulness and suitability of the systems theory an overview of the \\nAEC in the context of systems follows. \\n  The complexities of the AEC processes make it apparent that the or ganizational design of \\nthe principal firms cannot be properly addresse d without considering th e building industry as a \\nsystem within which such firms are components (Davidson, 1988). A model of such a system is \\nessential for understanding the br oader process and the ensuing influences that come to bear \\nupon these firms as well as the c ounterforce that the firms produce that \\'reshape\\' the system and \\nits environment. While often the emphasis is on the individual organizations rather than on the \\nAEC industry as a whole, an accurate view of th e influences that shape the organization could \\nnot be established without the guidance of a ho listic frame of reference. Such a frame of \\nreference is afforded through the application of  the systems approach. Morris (1973) described \\nthe systems approach as follows: \\'The primary concern of the systems approach is that any system should be treated as a w hole. It is recognized, however, that the individual interests \\nshould not go unrecognized.\" It is this \\'individual interest\\' of the firm that gives rise to the \\nconstruct of the firm\\'s performan ce as a distinct aspect that need s to be differentiated from the \\nproject\\'s performance.   \\nExtant models of the industry (Katsanis a nd Davidson, 1995) confirm the view that the \\nAEC industry is a system within a larger system - that of Society and that each enterprise is also \\na system within the AEC industry system. The AE C industry is therefore subject to prevailing ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These \\nsystem dynamics models try to identify and account  for the influences of such forces and hence \\ndeduce the direction of change  in building. Thus, they b ecome powerful instruments in \\nidentifying the impact such changes are likely to  have on the organizational design of the firm.   \\n \\nThe AEC Industry and its undertakings constitute systems of immense complexity. \\nConsider the Industry’s ultimate physical output: the Building. It takes considerable time to conceive, design and physically produce and it  consumes significant amounts of resources. \\nMajor projects are the result of collaborative  contributions of dozen s of professionals and \\nhundreds of commercial firms. In terms of c ontribution to GDP, the AEC industry accounts for \\n12-15% in direct output and 30-40% in related industries. Any effort to increase the performance \\nof the industry has a significant impact on the na tional economy. Yet, Sta tistics Canada data \\nshow that in recent years there is a widening gap between aggreg ate productivity increases in the \\noverall economy and the AEC.  \\n Efforts to increase performance have primarily  been technology driv en and are often at \\nthe trade level. A higher poten tial for productivity gains exists  through organizational process \\ninnovation, however, the fragmented nature of the AEC industry acts  as inhibitor to the adoption \\nof processes innovation. Considering that the industry has been entr enched in its constraints and \\ntraditions, the broader question is: Can the AEC industry be liberated  from the shackles of such \\nconstraints and traditions?  Posing the following targeted questions may identify the way to \\nsome answers. What strategies are available that can facilitate innovation at a scale that can make \\na difference? Can strategies th at have proved successful in other settings be considered \\nanalogous and thus appropriate for the AEC industry?  \\n \\n To consider these questions , this paper proposes a set of concepts, adapted from \\ncybernetics and systems, for dealing with complex ity in large systems by developing appropriate \\nstrategies. Before proceeding with  the discussion of these concepts it is necessary to briefly \\ndiscuss network organizations and performance in the AEC industry.  \\n \\nOrganizational Structure and Networks \\n \\nAccording to Maturana and Varela (1987): “Organization  denotes those relati ons that must exist \\namong the components of a system for it to be a member of a specific class.  Structure  denotes \\nthe components and relations that actually constitute a particular unity and make its organization \\nreal.  \\nThe purpose of the structure of the organizati on is to attain efficient utilization of \\nphysical and intellectual resource s. A variety of definitions of structure are found in literature: A \\nconcise definition of structure offered by Mintzber g (1979) is: “The structure of an organization \\ncan be defined simply as the sum total of the ways in which labor is divided into distinct tasks and then its coordination is achieved among these tasks\".

These st ructures are: The Functional; the Divisionalized; \\nthe Matrix; and the Network Organization. The sh ifts from functional to divizionalized and \\nsubsequently to matrix may be viewed as varia tions on what one might call the original theme, \\nthe functional form, whereas the latest shift – to network configur ation – is a radical \\nrevolutionary change from the traditional organi zational form. What distinguishes the first three \\nforms from the network form is the fact that all three sought to accumulate resources including \\npersonnel and through efficient utilization under the ge neral, hierarchical ove rsight of a central \\noffice improve overall organizational performance.    However, network organizations differ from the previous structures in  that they espouse a \\nheterarchical, distributed approach  to management of not necessarily  their own resources, at least \\nnot to the same extent of ownership previous ly sought by the organizations of traditional \\nstructure. This differentiation along with attributes describe d in Katsanis (2004) lends the \\nnetwork structure the potential to effect strate gic changes at a higher amplification level. To \\nappreciate the relationship between  structure and amplifications consider a simple system of \\nlever and fulcrum. Changes to the structure of th e system, i.e., the ratio of the lengths on either \\nside of the fulcrum changes the amplification ca pacity of such a system and consequently the \\nrelationship between input and output and the ensu ing performance or amplification capacity of \\nthe system. This analogy applies equally to the structure of the organizations with regard to \\noutput and input, the ratio of which defines performance.  \\n \\nPerformance in the AEC Industry \\n \\nWith respect to performance, the product of the bu ilding industry is a project  that culminates in a \\nbuilding. Therefore, it is important to look sp ecifically at project performance, and this has \\nreceived extensive attention by various re searchers (Mohsini and Davidson, 1992, 1987, 1986; \\nMohsini, 1984; Davidson, 1989). These studie s have focused on the organization and \\nmanagement of the building proc ess and the interorganizational conflicts among the participating \\ntask-organizations that inevitably aff ect performance in a negative way.  \\n  Mohsini and Davidson (1992) correlate key stru ctural variables (measures of conflict) of \\nthe task organization to the perf ormance variables of the project.  In building their model, through \\ncritical examination of the building process, th ey identify disparities between two levels of \\norganizational objectives that the multi-organizati on is continuously confr onted with: (1) Level I \\nobjectives – the temporary objectives  of the project and the organization that is set up to build it, \\nand (2) Level II – the permanent objectives of th e participating task organizations. The second \\nlevel of objectives includes those that are typical  of all permanent organizations, namely, their \\nsurvival in the marketplace, the enhancement of their domains, and their position in it and so on. \\n  The same concern is echoed by Mohsini (1989) when he charges that project \\nperformance evaluation has traditio nally been biased toward the Level I.

An answer is suggested by a set of \\nstrategies that have been proposed by Umpleby (1990) usi ng underlying assumption and theories \\nembedded in the domain of cybernetics and systems.   \\nVarious researchers have invoked the applica tion of systems and systems thinking in the \\nquest for amplification of performance. Acco rding to Senge (1990), the essence of Systems \\nThinking lies in the ability to shift from lower to higher level strategies as the circumstances \\nrequire. In doing so one must be able to discern the unde rlying circular interrel ations rather than \\nfocus on the more obvious linear cause-effect chains . In effect, Systems Thinking shifts the focus \\nof attention from symptomatic acti on to systemic action. It is in this shift that amplification is \\nachieved. The amplifying power of strategy shifts is well documented in the literature by authors \\nsuch as Senge (1990) and Beer (1972). Umpleby (1990) proposed a theory of regulation based on \\nthe law of requisite variety which st ates that the capacity in the regu lator must be at least equal to \\nthe capacity in the system to be regulated. One of the implications of this statement is that it \\naddresses structural issu es of the system. Umpleby (1990) wa s the first to attach quantitative \\nvalues to such amplifications. He has identified f our levels of strategies shown in Table 1. In the \\none-to-one regulation of variety ea ch side must match each of its opponent’s moves with its own. \\nIn the one-to-one regulation of disturbance amplif ication is achieved b ecause most citizens are \\nlaw abiding and it is only ne cessary to control criminals.  In ecological regulation, the \\nconstituents of the set exercise self-policin g and compliance with re gulations. Finally, in \\nepistemological regulation amplifi cation is achieved through a conc eptual shift th at changes the \\ngame itself. The last strategy example refers to the report to the Club of Rome The Limits to \\nGrowth .  Every time there is a shift to a higher level strategy a gain in amplification results by a \\nfactor of approximately a thousand. Umpleby points out that these strategies can be used at any \\nlevel of analysis.     These four strategies of re gulation can be easily applie d to the AEC industry. Table 2 \\nshows the proposed analogy of these strategies a pplied to the AEC industry. In the one-to-one \\nregulation of variety an example analogous to th e football game one can see the coordination of \\ntrade- persons by a general contractor. In the one- to-one regulation of dist urbance the variety is \\nreduced by delegating the coordination of trade-pe rsons to several sub-c ontractors. Ecological \\nregulation is achieved by changi ng the rules of the game thr ough partnering. In the partnering \\nparadigm, the aim is to redefine the norms that  govern business relations thus establishing new a \\nconduct for business. (Katsanis and Davidson,  1995). The fourth strategy, Epistemological \\nRegulation, requires changing the game itself. Umpleby’s example demonstrates the potency of \\nthis strategy but it is also indicative of the magnitude and circumstance s of such undertaking. \\nHas the AEC seen an analogous example?

This emphasis  stems from a growing recognition of the centrality \\nof the project manager’s competency and authority to the performance of  projects (Jaselskis and Ashley \\n1991). Construction project managers now operate with  a significant degree of power and autonomy in \\nreturn for increased responsibility for the operational performance of their projects. They must fulfill a \\nnumber of roles including those of facilitator, coor dinator, motivator and politician (Briner et al 1996). \\nThis demanding and multifaceted role has necess itated the development of more sophisticated \\napproaches to managing their development and pe rformance in a way which supports both specific \\nproject objectives and the wider business goals of th e organization.

The aim of  this paper is to summarize the cumulative outputs \\nof this research program and to discuss a possible way forward with relation to future research into \\nproject manager competence and development.  \\n \\nProject Management Competence \\n \\nEstablishing the competence or competency of an individual or occupational role has been \\nseen as an increasingly versatile and powerful t ool in contemporary human resource management \\n(HRM) practice (Collin 1997). Such assessments can help  to define job-role ch aracteristics and desired \\nlevels of performance and hence, can provide a basis for many aspects of the human resource \\ndevelopment (HRD) function. However, although the us e of the terms ‘competence’ and ‘competency’ \\nis fairly indiscriminate, there are important concep tual and practical distinc tions to be made that \\nfundamentally effect their applicat ion within modern organizations. Competence  relates to a person’s \\nability to comply to a range of ex ternally agreed standards, whereas competency  refers to personal \\nattributes that a person draws upon as part of their work activities (Roberts 1997). Thus, whereas \\ncompetence is a work-related concept that defines the areas of work at which a person needs to be \\ncompetent, ‘competency’ is a person-related concept that refers to  the dimensions of behavior  \\nunderlying competent performance (Woodruffe 1991). Thus, displaying competency is not about \\ndemonstrating an ability to comply with minimum st andards of functional perf ormance, but relates to \\nunderlying behavioral characteristic s that tend to result in effec tive performance (Mansfield 1999). \\nThese are variously defined in terms of those essen tial personal traits, skills,  knowledge and motives of \\nthe employee that have been causally relate d to superior managerial performance.  \\n \\nWithin the UK, measuring performance agai nst competence standards has formed the \\ndominant paradigm for both performance measurement and performance management. This is rooted in the Employment Department’s Standards program,  which defines competence as a description of \\nsomething that a person who works in a given occ upational area should be able to do. This model \\nexpresses competence in terms of the job purpose a nd the standards of performance expected to be \\nachieved (i.e. actions and outcomes that a person shoul d be able to demonstrate). This approach has \\nbeen widely criticized for the inappropriate and infl exible standards that it promotes, particularly for \\nhigher-level and managerial positions (Cole 2002 : 368). Such a model cannot take account of the \\ncomplex and dynamic context in which managerial behaviors may be carried out; high performing \\nmanagers do not simply apply required actions, but are conscious of how they  manage, reflect on their \\nactions, experiment, and in so doing learn and develop (Kolb & Fry 1984).  \\n \\nThe Case for Competency-Based Performance Thinking in Construction \\n \\nMost companies now accept the importance of utilizing and developing the potential of \\nemployees in order to enhance their competitive and dynamic capabilities (B ratton & Gold 1999). As \\nsuch, performance management has replaced perfor mance appraisal as the way to manage employee \\nperformance (Torrington and Hall 1995).  It is based on a cyclical and continuous process of \\nperformance planning, employee assessment and co rrective action (Ainsworth and Smith 1993). In \\nrecent years it has received consid erable attention in both the academ ic and practitioner-oriented HRM \\nliterature, largely because perfor mance management systems encompass the support, development and \\nreward of employees, set within the context of  organizational objectives (Williams 1998). This \\nacknowledges the centrality of the development of people to the achievement of strategic business \\nobjectives, which is better aligned w ith the tenets of the HRM new ort hodoxy. Thus, it is crucial that the \\ncompetencies which form the basis of a performa nce management system accord with the abilities ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Traditionally, such measures have \\ntypically relied upon appraising managers against a ra nge of job-role requir ements and output-based \\nperformance criteria.

The methodol ogy used to support this program \\nof research took its lead from the established McBer job competency assessment process initially \\ndeveloped for industrial psychol ogy by David McClelland (1973). This  comprises the following steps \\n(the related stage of this research program is stated in parentheses): the identification of criteria defining \\neffective performance ( Phase 1 ); the identification of a criterion sample group of superior performers \\nand a comparison group of average employees ( Phase 2 ); data collection th rough behavioral event \\ninterviews ( Phase 2 ); the identification of co mpetencies that distinguish superior from average \\nperformers ( Phase 2 ); the validation of the competency model ( Phase 2 ); and the application of the \\nmodel to a range of HRM functions ( Phase 3 ) (see Spencer and Spencer, 1993) . In addition, the research \\nprogram also undertook an additional stage ( Phase 4 ), which aimed to identify the types of training \\ninterventions required to induce the kinds of behavi oral change necessary for managerial development \\nwithin the project management role.  All four phases of the research were carri ed out with a range of \\nleading industrial collaborators. Th ese included two contractors (both of which were in the UK’s top 20 \\nby turnover) and a leading project management consulta ncy which acted as a control to ensure that the \\ncompetencies identified were also applicable to t hose working on behalf of construction clients as well \\nas contractors. Clearly, it is not possible to detail the fi ndings of all four phases of the research in a \\nsingle paper of this size. Rather, th e aim of this paper is to draw t ogether the principal findings of the \\nresearch program and to reflect on their significance for the industry.  \\n Phase 1 – Defining a ‘successful ’ construction project manager: An important initial step in this \\nresearch was to identify the criteria or metrics that define superior or effect ive performance in the job \\nrole to be studied. Without such a framework it would not be possible to identify the superior \\nperformers from whom key leadership and manageme nt behaviors could be id entified. The approach \\nadopted was to use a series of focus groups to bring together senior managers, HRM specialists, project \\nmanagers and project team members to discuss the criteria that pr oject managers’ performance should \\nbe measured against.  These were run in differe nt partner organizations and comprised a stratified \\nsample of managers ranging from  first line supervisors to seni or head office based managers. \\nParticipants were encouraged to discuss openly thei r views of the criteria of performance excellence \\nagainst which construction project ma nagers should be evaluated.  The full range of criteria was then \\nlisted and the original participants asked to rank th e importance of each criteri on on a seven point Likert \\nscale on an individual basis. Factor analysis was used as the data reduc tion tool to reduce the number of \\nsuccess indicators to a manageable a nd meaningful number of criteria e xpressed as factors.

Factors 1, 2 and 3 em bodied what could be described as the basic \\nmanagement abilities required within  the project-based environment. The team building  indicators \\ngrouped under Factor 1 suggested th at a key performance measure s hould be their effectiveness in \\nmanaging team socio-dynamics in order to create a teamwork environment that encouraged low staff \\nturnover and stability.  Factor 2, labeled leadership , included abilities of  delegation directing, \\nassertiveness and monitoring, which were joined with thos e of planning ahead a nd taking responsibility. \\nFactor 3, labeled decision-making , encompassed several pr oduction-related indicators as well as more \\ngeneral management attributes.  Fact or 4 was interpreted as representing mutuality and approachability . \\nThis category embodied the need for the project manager to engender indi vidual trust and mutual \\nrespect between themselves and their subordinates in order to create an appropr iate workplace culture.  \\nFactor 5 focused on the need for the manager to be honest  and to show integrity , both in terms of the \\nmanagement of internal team relations, but also extern ally to the client and ot her project stakeholders.  \\nCommunication  issues were embodied under Factor 6, wh ere the ability to transfer knowledge \\neffectively both within the team and to external stak eholders were seen as cruc ially important.  Factor 7 \\nfocused on the manager's abilities and performance in learning  and understanding  situations and then in \\napplying  their skills rapidly within  the project environment.  The issues embodied within self-efficacy  \\nwere all contained within Factor 8.  This cate gory contained aspects rela ted to self-motivation, \\nenthusiasm, self-discipline and ambition, along with tim e management and initiati ve.  The final factor 9, \\nmaintenance of external relations , incorporated most of the measur es that related to the project \\nmanager's interface with those outside  of their immediate workgroup.  It is notable that the traditional \\noutturn measures of time, cost and quality were  not defined as key crite ria by the focus groups.  \\n \\nPhase 2 – Identification of core beha viors of successful  project managers: The second research phase \\naimed to utilize the success criter ia identified in Phase 1 to sel ect a group of superior performing \\nmanagers from whom core competencies could be id entified. These core competencies and behaviors of \\nsuch managers formed the basis of the performance management tools developed in Phase 3. In order to \\nfacilitate the selection of such managers, an ‘expert  panel’ of HRM specialists , senior managers, project \\nmanagers and other site-based managers from the tw o participating constructi on companies were invited \\nto identify a total of 40 ‘s uperior’ performers and 20 ‘average’ perf ormers against the criteria emerging \\nin phase 1. The expert panel carefully assessed ma nagers’ performance agains t the nine criteria and \\ndiscussed each candidate until a collective agreemen t was formed as to the ‘superior’ and ‘average’ \\nperformers. Following this, a variety of data were co llected from the managers selected. Initially, they \\nwere asked to describe their j ob tasks and key respons ibilities in order to identify competence \\nrequirements of their roles. Next, behavioral even t interviews were used to assess the behaviors \\nunderlying effective performance in their role. Interv iewees were asked to recount an occasion where \\nthey had to manage a complex or problematic situati on or event. The behavioral event interviews were \\ntranscribed verbatim and then coded in accordance with the McBer Competency Dictionary (Spencer \\nand Spencer 1993). Forward stepwise logistic regre ssion analysis was then carried out to create a \\nparsimonious model to predict job performance based on the results emerging from the study. The \\nmodel was validated by using the model to predict the performance of a s econd criterion sample (see \\nDainty et al 2004).  \\nThe results revealed that 12 competencies distinguis hed superior managers from average performers as \\nfollows. Achievement orientation  refers to the manager’s concern for working towards a standard of \\nexcellence. A conceptually related trait is that of using initiative .

Another \\ninterrelated competency concerns the need for flexibility  in terms of the ability to adapt to and work \\neffectively with a variety of situ ations. This additionally requires that the project manager understands \\nand appreciates different and opposing perspectives on an issue, and is able to adapt their approach as \\nthe requirements of a situation changes. Information seeking  refers to an underlyi ng curiosity or desire \\nto know more about things, people, or issues. This co mpetency can be seen to underpin others within the \\nframework, such as focusing on client needs , a self-explanatory competency relating to efforts to meet \\ntheir client’s requirements, coupled with  a desire to help or serve others. Impact and influence  refers to \\nthe intention to persuade, convince,  influence or impress others in or der to support their agenda, or the \\ndesire to have a specific impact or  effect on others. However, success in influencing the team can also \\nbe seen to be dependent upon the manager’s directiveness/assertiveness  in terms of ensuring that \\nsubordinates comply with his/her wishes in the way that was intended. Similarly, teamwork and \\ncooperation , the intention to work cooperatively with othe rs as opposed to separately or competitively, \\nis a pre-requisite for infl uencing the team to perform in a desirable manner. Team leadership  is perhaps \\nthe most obvious managerial ability linked to working within the construction project environment. It is \\nclosely related to the other categories here in that it re fers to the intention to take a role as leader of a \\nteam or other group. Two competencies refer to the ab ility of the project mana ger to conceive, analyze \\nand reason in order to make appr opriate management decisions; analytical thinking  refers to the need to \\ndevelop understanding of a situat ion or problem by breaking it dow n into component parts, and \\nconceptual thinking  relates to developing an  understanding of a situation or problem through the \\nidentification of patterns or connect ions between situations  that are not obviously  apparent. Together \\nthese abilities can be seen to support reasoned and considered deci sion-making, embodied within the \\nbehavior labeled composure . This refers to the self-control of th e individual manager and their ability to \\ncontrol emotions inappropriate to a particular envir onment or situation. The logi stic regression revealed \\nthat superior performance can be predicted with a high level of confidence on the basis of only two key \\nmanagement behaviors; ‘composure’ and ‘team leader ship’. Possession of these attributes suggests that \\nan individual is likely to be endowed with a degree of competency in the others.   \\n \\nPhase 3 – Applications for the competency framework: The emergence of two predictive competencies \\nfor identifying construction project ma nager’s likely performance is that they provide a basis for a range \\nof HRM functions linked to the recruitment, selection and deve lopment of managers within \\norganizations. These applications ar e discussed in detail in Cheng et al (2005) and are summarized \\nbelow:  \\n \\n• Performance management  - competency profiles arguably offer an improved benchmark against \\nwhich managers’ performance can be  assessed. Examples were extrac ted from the behavioral event \\ninterviews and then used as benchmarks against wh ich other managers can self -rate their performance. \\nThese are refined through disc ussions with line managers.  \\n• Team deployment and job-matching  – by identifying an individual manager’s competency profile and \\nreconciling this against the competency  profile for a particular role or  position, the degree of fit can be \\nestablished; the better the fit, the higher the probab ility of an individual ac hieving job satisfaction and \\nthe better their performance and li kelihood of being retained. This is being applied to team selection.  \\n• Recruitment and selection  - The effective use of the model in th e recruitment proce ss demands that the \\ncharacteristics of the various beha viors (and particularly the two pred ictive competencies) are clearly \\nidentifiable through that process. Both composure and team leadership beha viors are tested using \\nstandard psychometrics.

Successfully induc ing behavioral change at the le vel of the individual within an \\norganizational setting demands a sensitive approach to HRD which must reconcile the individual \\nmanager’s change requirements with the performance needs of the organization. The fourth phase of the \\nresearch aimed to achieve this thr ough several interrelated re search stages to be unde rtaken as part of a \\nlongitudinal study. This enabled the imp acts and effects of the learning a nd intervention strategies to be \\nmonitored, evaluated and refined in  order that they induced tangibl e benefits for the participating \\nbusinesses. The approach adopted was to use the Transtheoretical Model  (TTM) to measure the \\nreadiness for change of individual managers in relation to each of  the behaviors shown to underpin \\nperformance excellence. This model is the most infl uential approach to the integration of behavior \\nchange theories and practices within the healthca re sphere, and recent development of the TTM has \\napplied it to the development of tailored change  management programs for businesses (Prochaska, \\n2000). The TTM approach suggests that, for people to  elicit a positive behavioral change, they must go \\nthrough a process of improving their readiness  to change. In other words,  before a new behavior or \\naction can occur, the individual must have the ri ght attitude and beliefs to embrace it, or receive \\nappropriate intervention strategi es to induce such a change.  \\n \\nAll 600 project-based employees of the participating orga nization were surveyed. The results showed \\nthat only people in the precontemplation stage (ar ound 10% of the respondents) believed that the \\nadvantages of adopting the identified competencies did not outweigh the disadva ntages. Belief in the \\nadvantages of adopting the competencies increase d substantially between the precontemplation and \\ncontemplation stages. As such, maximizing the benef its of developing learning interventions suggested \\nthat the company should target thos e most skeptical of the value of the competencies embodied within \\nthe performance management tool. Th e detailed results from this group were used to refine a set of \\nstrategies to shift their decisional balance in fa vor of the adoption of the competencies. This was \\nachieved through a dual strategy of increasing employees’ understandin g of how adopting the behaviors \\nwould benefit both themselv es and the company combined with efforts to make them more simple and \\neasy to understand (i.e. through raising consciousne ss, line management reinforcement and supporting \\nrelationships). The results revealed that different  forms of intervention will be required depending upon \\nthe individual’s profile with regard to managerial be haviors, stage of change, readiness to change and \\nlearning styles. By establishing bespoke change strategies, the objective is to engender a more \\nparticipative employee-centered ch ange strategy that should enha nce the well-being of both the \\nindividual and the organization.   \\n \\nDiscussion and Directions for Future Research \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Whilst their \\nutilization is by no means unproblema tic (as the resistance of some of the managers suggests), the \\napproach could have far-reaching implications fo r the ways in which construction organizations \\nmeasure and manage the performance of their mana gement employees. Notably, the strength of the \\nresults calls into question the primacy of normativ e micro-competency based approaches which rely \\nupon the assessment of minimum standards of performa nce. These traditional approaches arguably do \\nlittle to engender performance ex cellence amongst the industry’s key managers. In contrast, the \\ncompetency framework presented here has a variet y of applications rangi ng from recruitment and \\nreward management to succession planning. Thus, it is  suitable for promoting behaviors that enable \\nmanagers to develop independe ntly within their role.  \\n Despite the significance of the findings , the outcomes of the study also ra ise other questions relating to \\nthe future measurement of managers' performance w ithin the sector.  A firs t question concerns the \\ndefinition of what we mean by project management in  a construction context.  Many definitions of the \\nfunction exist, but almost all are founded on the prem ise that their primary objective is to achieve time, \\ncost and quality targets. Another issue concerns the applicability of standard performance frameworks \\nwithin construction.  Whilst there are some important ge neric criteria appropriate to project managers in \\nall industries, it is also arguable th at the choice of performance measur es is influenced by project type \\nand industry classification (see T ukel and Rom, 2001). The findings  of this study suggest that \\nconstruction has some specific char acteristics which demand bespoke performance measures.  In terms \\nof future directions for this research it is clear that  there is a need to examine the role-based (context \\nbound) nature of competency within the construction workplace. Crawfo rd (2005) asserts that there is, \\nin fact, no statistically significant relationship between  performance against the widely used competency \\nstandards and senior management perceptions of pr oject management performance. This suggests that \\nanother dimension of competence exists  which is rooted in the ability of  managers to capitalize on their \\nsocio-political understanding of the pr oject and its stakeholders in a wa y which utilizes their attributes \\neffectively. This ‘third dimension’  of project management competen ce requires further investigation.  \\n \\nConclusions \\n \\nThere is a growing awareness with in construction of the relationship between project performance and \\nthe competencies of project managers as eviden ced in terms of key behaviors. This paper has \\nsummarized the cumulative findings of a four-y ear program of research comprising three \\ncomplimentary projects. It has brie fly explained the various phases of the research, summarizing the key \\noutcomes of each stage, which have: identified th e competencies of leading construction project \\nmanagers; developed them into performance manageme nt/HRD tools, and refine d an associated set of \\nlearning interventions to enable managers to unde rgo the behavioral change necessary to achieve \\nmanagerial excellence. Together, the research project s have developed a set of  practicable tools proven \\nto develop high performance leaders of the constr uction process and have shown the potential of \\ncompetency-based approaches to act as a ba sis for management development programs.  \\n \\nReferences \\n \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Although resear ch toward improvements in management areas \\nis important, the authors believe the correspondin g need for leadership skills development has \\nnot been adequately researched.  The constructio n industry is dominated by engineers of various \\ndisciplines who initially entered the field because of their interest in, and academic aptitude for, \\nhard technical skills.  There is increasingly a need for engineers in project management positions \\nto also have people oriented skills , i.e. leadership skills, to comp lement their technical skills.   \\n The research summarized in this paper compared  two groups of construction project managers \\nwithin a major, international, United States ba sed construction company.  A top performer group \\nwas selected by corporate executives, while the control group was selected at random.  Project \\nmanagers were administered a 360-degree l eadership analysis, and also completed a \\nsupplementary questionnaire to provide demographi c and leadership causal influence data.  The \\nresearch data were analyzed using standard stat istical analysis techniques.

Fo r example, in 2000, the Accreditation Board for \\nEngineering and Technology instituted new E ngineering Criteria standards, requiring \\nengineering schools to ensure a more balanced  education program.  This program would \\nincorporate courses in non-t echnical skills such as communications and the economic and \\nsocietal constraints on engineer ing. The goal is to produce engin eers capable of excelling in a \\nworld that combines technological, scientific, an d social issues with problems that cannot be \\nsolved solely with a technical approach (Williams 2003).  Other publ ications (Powell 2002; \\nBergeron 2001; Grose 2004) have documented th e need for engineers to develop leadership \\nskills to accompany their technical skills.  The American Society of Civil Engineers has made several efforts to revise the academic standard s required for professiona l licensing. The latest \\ninitiative requires three new cat egories of expertise before li censes are awarded: understanding \\nof professional practice issues, l eadership and public policy, and t echnical depth in a specialized \\narea of civil engine ering (Civil 2004). \\n John P. Kotter (Kotter 1990) explained that  management is about planning, budgeting, \\norganization, staffing, controlling, and problem-sol ving, whereas leadership is about establishing \\ndirection, aligning people, and motivating and in spiring others.  This definition was the one \\nutilized in the research.  This paper summarizes a resear ch project that was undertaken in 2003-04 at Clemson University \\nwith the cooperation of, and funding from, a ma jor international cons truction company.  The \\nauthors’ premise was that all construction managers require leadership skills. The research analyzed the leadership differences between a top performing group of  construction project \\nmanagers and a control group of similarly as signed managers, as measured by a 360-degree \\nevaluation tool.  The research al so identified the causal influences  that may have generated the \\ndifferences in leadership perf ormance between the two groups. \\n \\nRESEARCH METHODOLOGY \\n \\nThe Clemson University research initiative summarized herein assumed the following principles: 1) leadership behaviors are taught and learned, rather than being i nherent characteristics; 2) the \\nvalidated instrument used to measure leadersh ip behaviors, the Kouzes-Posner Leadership \\nPractices Inventory, or LPI (Kou zes and Posner 2002a), is appli cable to construction project \\nmanagers; and 3) the participants in this study trusted the well-advertis ed condition that this \\nresearch was anonymous and not being used fo r individual personnel ev aluation, and therefore \\nprovided truthful answers to all questions on the questionnaires. \\n This paper addresses two hypothese s, the first being that a group of top performing construction \\nproject managers has different, and better, leader ship behaviors than a control group of randomly \\nselected construction project managers, as measured by the Kouzes-Posner LPI. The null hypothesis was stated as: “the leadership behaviors of top performing construction project \\nmanagers are equal to or less th an the leadership behaviors of  a control group of construction \\nproject managers.” The alternat e hypothesis was stated as: “the  leadership behaviors of top ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The null hypothesis was stated as, “the causal influences of top performing construction pr oject managers are equal to the \\ncausal influences of a control group of construction project mana gers.”  The alternate hypothesis \\nwas stated as: “the causal infl uences of top performing constr uction project managers are not \\nequal to the causal influences of the control group of construction pr oject managers.”   \\n \\nStudy Population\\n \\n The authors selected for study and analysis a large and diverse United States based international \\nconstruction company, with reve nue of more than $3.7 billion in 2003. The company has more \\nthan 25,000 employees, 335 of whom are constructi on project managers.  For study purposes, a \\nconstruction project manager: 1) oversees the op eration of a project, including safeguarding \\ncompany funds, property, and employees; 2) represents  the company with resp ect to the client; 3) \\ncompletes projects to the satisfaction of the client , consistent with cost, schedule, and contractual \\nrequirements; 4) ensures that established compan y goals are realized while maintaining client \\nrelations that will enhance future business; and 5) has authority for independent action, exercise of judgment, and discretion within the limits of company policy.  This definition clearly applies \\nto project managers involved in engineer/p rocure/construct (EPC) pr ojects. Typically, EPC \\nprojects are built from a bare or near-bare base, where no or only limited facilities exist. On the other hand, many construction project managers also  are involved in operations and maintenance \\n(O&M) projects, in which existi ng facilities are operated, improved, upgraded, or modified for \\nsafety, production, or efficiency reasons.  B ecause the study company had a substantial number \\nof managers involved in O& M projects, it was decided to include both EPC and O&M \\nconstruction project managers in the research.  The project sponsor identified an  alphabetical listing of 335 cons truction project managers. To \\ngenerate statistically si gnificant results from this analysis , two groups of 40 project managers \\nwere selected. The first group consisted of 40 to p performers, as identified by corporate senior \\nexecutives. The determination of top performa nce was based on consistent performance in \\nexceeding company objectives in areas such as qua lity, safety, cost, comm unications, and client \\nrelations.  The control group consis ted of 40 construction project managers, selected by using an \\nExcel random number generator.  The contro l group was selected by removing the 40 top \\nperformers from the list of 335 e ligible construction project managers, and then selecting 40 \\nother construction project managers at random fr om the remaining 295 personnel. This analysis \\nof 80 leaders could have potentially resulted in  a sample of 80 of th e 335 construction project \\nmanagers, for a sample size of approximately 24% of the total availa ble.  The number of \\nparticipants in each group was set at 40 to allo w for possible non-completions while maintaining \\nat least 30 responses in each group. Because each individual res ponse required a supplementary \\nquestionnaire and completion of seven to 10 questionnaires for the 360-degree analysis, \\nobtaining two groups of 30 was considered to be  a substantial undertakin g.

A s upplementary questionnaire was \\nused to capture demographic data, including age,  gender, EPC versus O&M experience, and type \\nand amount of formal education, as well as op inions related to leadership development \\nexperience.  \\n \\nMeasurement Tools  \\n In the leadership research community, the 360-de gree measurement process is generally accepted \\nas a viable tool for quantitativel y measuring varying levels of l eadership behavior (Goleman et. \\nal. 2002; Kouzes and Posner 2002a; Welch 2001;  Zenger and Folkman 2002). The term “360-\\ndegree” derives from the analysis methodology: th e individuals involved evaluate themselves \\nand also are evaluated by managers, co-worke rs, direct reports, and customers or other \\nconstituents. This methodology is in contrast to the traditional appr oach in which an individual is \\nevaluated only by his or her supe rvisor. The strengths of the 3 60-degree approach are that it \\nprovides a more complete evaluation, pena lizes an individual who focuses on only one \\nconstituency (e.g., the boss), and has the potential to re sult in a more balanced and accurate \\nassessment.  The Leadership Practices Inventory, or LPI, was used to quantify the leadership behaviors of \\nconstruction project managers in  this research.  The LPI has been validated internally and \\nexternally, and it has been repor ted as providing consistently re liable and valid findings across \\npeople, gender, ethnicity, cu ltural backgrounds, and related or ganizations. As a validated \\nresearch tool, it has been used for more than  15 years to evaluate more than 350,000 managers \\nand non-managers across a wide variety of disciplines, organizations, and demographic \\npopulations.  Additionally, more than 200 publis hed masters’ degree theses and doctoral \\ndissertations have used the LPI as a leadership  analysis and data colle ction tool (Kouzes and \\nPosner 2000a).   The LPI questionnaire consists of 30 questions, six for each of the five basic leadership practices \\n(Kouzes and Posner, 2002, pg 13):  \\n• Model The Way \\n• Inspire A Shared Vision \\n• Challenge The Process \\n• Enable Others To Act \\n• Encourage The Heart. \\n \\nThe responder answers each query on a scale of  1 (almost never) to 10 (almost always), thus \\ngenerating a score of 6 to 60 for each of the fi ve categories. For each category, an individual \\nreceived three scores: a self-score (LPI-Self), his or her ma nager’s score (LPI-Manager), and an \\naverage score of all evaluations  completed, regardless of type (LPI-Average), resulting in 15 \\nscores for analysis for each participant.  Because at least seven separate evaluations were used to \\ngenerate the LPI-Average scores (the true 360- degree evaluation) for each individual, the LPI-\\nAverage values were deemed to be a more accu rate representation of an individual’s true \\nleadership performance than the LPI-Self or LPI-Manager values.

The first part of the questionnaire requested general information with respect to age \\nand education along with questions  addressing the casua l influences such as: job experience, \\nproject management experience, formal management  training, formal lead ership training, and job \\nassignments.  The second part of the questi onnaire solicited information related to the \\nrespondent’s perceptions as to th e importance of various leadersh ip influences on their career \\ndevelopment.  These leadership influences incl uded observing, mentorin g or coaching by others, \\nreading and self study, education, training, and job experience.  Th e respondents were asked to \\nrate the importance of these influences on a scal e of 1 to 10, with 1 indicating “absolutely not”, \\nand 10 indicating “absolutely yes”.  A rating of 8 indicated that the survey influence “usually” \\nimpacted their career development.  \\n \\nData Analysis Process\\n \\n The data from the LPI questionnaires were en tered into an LPI Scoring Software program \\n(Pfeiffer & Company at John Wiley & Sons , Inc., Indianapolis, IN; or online at \\nwww.LeadershipChallenge.com\\n). This program produced a feedback sheet of numerical data for \\neach participant, identifying areas that needed  improvement.  The supplementary questionnaire \\nalso generated numerical data.  Both sets of data  were entered into excel sheets.  The Statistical \\nAnalysis System (SAS) Process Means (SAS Inst itute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used to generate \\ndescriptive statistics of the LPI results and supplementary questionnai re results for the two \\ngroups of construction project managers.  The re sults then were analyzed using two-sample t-\\nTests.  \\nAn important decision in this analysis was the level selected for the t ype-I error. Based on a \\nliterature review, it was determined  that setting the type-I error α value at 0.10, and having 90% \\nconfidence in the resulting analys is, would be acceptable. The reas ons for this decision were: 1) \\nbecause many researchers have failed to find st atistically significant results in leadership \\nresearch, setting the type -I error at 0.10 would provide a more  generous opportunity for success; \\n2) the results of this research would not result in catastrophe or loss of human life if they were \\ninaccurate, so a larger α value is acceptable; and 3) a value of 0.10 provides a larger chance of a \\ntype-I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true), which is preferable to \\nmaking a type-II error (accepting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is false). A type-II \\nerror would accept the null hypotheses as true, and offer no assistance to the construction \\nindustry in leadership development. Given the choices, making a type-I error is preferable \\nbecause at least some direction can be provide d to the construction i ndustry for leadership \\ndevelopment options. \\n \\nDATA ANALYSIS  \\n \\nResponse Rate\\n \\n Table 1 identifies the total number of potential participants in th e research, as well as the actual \\nnumber of participants in each group who were  selected, and ultimately responded.

The se ven leadership influences cited \\non the survey were observing, mentoring or coachi ng by seniors, reading or  self study, education \\ncourses during college, education courses since college, company tr aining, and job experience.  \\nThe purpose of this section of the survey was to determine if top performers assigned significantly different values of importance to these potential sour ces of leadership development \\nthan the control group.  It was anticipated that the results of the analysis would identify strategies \\nfor the development of projec t manager leadership skills. \\n A portion of the survey data analysis is illust rated in Table 3.  Two leadership influences \\nindicated statistical differences between the groups: mentoring and coaching by seniors, and \\nreading and self- study.  It is in teresting to note that mentorin g and coaching requires the support \\nof others whereas reading and self -study requires the initiat ive of the individual.  This particular \\nfinding is in agreement with the lit erature, which states that learni ng leadership is very personal, \\nand usually requires the initiative  of the individual for self- improvement (Bennis 2003; Kotter \\n1990; Tichy 1997).  The mean values shown in Table 3 should also be carefully examined.  Both groups strongly believed that observing and job expe rience were the primary influen ces.

The research null hypothesis \\nwas rejected, and the aut hors accepted the alternat e hypothesis; “The leadership behaviors of top \\nperforming construction project managers are greate r (better) than the leadership behaviors of \\ncontrol group construction proj ect managers.”  The top performing construction project \\nmanagers were assessed to be significantly different  (better) at leadership traits that included the \\nability to align organizational actions with shar ed visions, enlist othe rs into a common vision, \\nand seek ways to change, grow, and improve. Th e general leadership li terature supports this \\ncontention.  This finding implies th at organizations should strive to  establish a leadership culture \\nfrom top to bottom throughout the organization to  have a sustained positive impact at every \\nlevel.  Both the top performer and control groups va lued the importance of job experience and \\nobserving as major causal influences on leadersh ip development, but the top performer group \\nplaced statistically significant higher emphasis on the importance of mentoring and coaching, \\nand reading and self study. The lit erature review also supports this  position.  This finding implies \\nthat leaders at all levels need  to realize the significant impor tance of setting the example, \\ncoaching, and mentoring for the enhanced deve lopment of present and future construction \\nproject managers.

Attention to causal \\ninfluences may help in the development of impr oved leadership skills in construction project \\nmanagers.  Revising college curriculums and te aching techniques can be done, but the results \\nwill take years to become apparent.  Howeve r, many of the required actions by industry and \\nindividuals are comparatively inexpensive, a nd simply require a new focus on leadership.  \\nOrganizations can develop a cultu re of teaching, mentoring, self study, and frequent job changes \\nto develop improved leadership and management skills.  Organizations can also use their own \\nhighly qualified personnel to offer formal in -house leadership and management training.  \\nIndividuals can show initiative in self st udy, reading, observing, and attempting to practice \\nproportionately more leadership than in the pa st.  For too long the construction industry has \\nfocused on management, to the exclusion of leader ship.  More research, as well as determined \\napplication, may make a difference to the future  competitiveness of the construction industry.   \\n \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \\n \\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Barry Po sner for his permission to reproduce the LPI \\nquestionnaire and use the associated an alysis software for this research. \\n \\nREFERENCES \\n \\nBadger, Bill and Dean Kashiwagi.  “Leadersh ip Principles vs. Ma nagement Control.”  Specialty \\nConference on Leadership and Management in Construction .

Leadership has two key components – social skills (associated with \\ninfluencing people to act) and problem-solving sk ills (associated with developing a plan of \\naction or goal to work towards). Incorporatin g leadership skill development in construction \\ntraining programs requires that both types of sk ills (social and problem-solving) be addressed. \\nThis paper suggests a Skills-Based Model for deve lopment of leadership skills in construction \\norganizations. This model recognizes that leaders move from a novice level to an expert level by \\nacquiring skills through progressively more comp lex work assignments. A practical implication \\nof this model in construction organizations is th at mangers need to expose workers to different \\nwork experiences and provide them with opport unities to solve progressively more complex \\nproblems.  \\nIntroduction \\n \\nLeadership is of fundamental  importance to effective management of construction \\nprojects, independent of size, sector or location (D ainty et al. 2005; Odusami 2002). It is \\nimportant at all levels of construction admi nistration from field s upervision to company \\nmanagement. Given the importance of leadership  to the success of an organization, it is \\nsurprising how few construction orga nizations take an ac tive role in leadership development. \\nOne of the reasons for this lack of action may be  associated with the fact that people define \\nleadership differently. Even with different  definitions of leadership, there are many \\ncommonalities. Farr et al. (1997) identifie d the following commonalities among several \\ndefinitions of leadership –  “leadership is an inte rpersonal influence process that is goal directed \\nand purposive.” McCuen (1999) takes a similar appro ach in stating that “leadership consists of \\nthe knowledge and skills that the individual po ssesses and employs to persuade others to \\nenthusiastically work toward the completion of the plan of action that the leader has established.” \\nBased on these definitions, leadership has two ke y components – social skills (associated with \\ninfluencing people to act) and problem-solving sk ills (associated with developing a plan of \\naction or goal to work towards).

Complicating the creation of \\nleadership development programs in construction or ganizations is the diffi culty in differentiating \\nbetween management and leadership. Management is  generally defined by th e skills necessary to \\ncomplete a task. For construction projects thes e skills may include technical skills (e.g., \\nplanning, scheduling, cost estimating, or craft sk ills) as well as basic social skills (e.g., \\ncommunication skills). These are the skills that  many construction organi zations focus on when \\ndeveloping training programs. Management is the application of these skills using rules, such as management-by-exception (Clough  et al.  2000). The application of ma nagement rules can ensure \\nthat tasks are completed; however, the success of a construction organization rests not only on \\ncompleting tasks, but completing them succe ssfully (i.e., profitabl y, safely, and with \\nconsideration for human resources). The differe nce between completing a task and completing a \\ntask successfully relies on employees evolving fr om a management role to a leadership role. \\nLeadership skills build on basic management skills by adding motivation and advanced problem-solving skills.  \\nAs a starting point for developing leader ship training programs in construction \\norganizations, this paper presents a Skills-Based Model for leadership development and recommends how this model can be incorpor ated into constructi on training programs. \\n \\nSkills-Based Model of Leadership Development \\n \\nMumford et al.  (2000c) presents a skills-based mode l of leadership development based \\non observations of officers in the United States Army. This skills-based model contends that \\nleadership ultimately depends on the ability to solve novel, ill-defined problems. The skills \\nneeded to solve these types of problems include problem-solving skills, social judgment skills, \\nand social skills. Problem-solving skills include be ing able to identify and understand a problem \\nand develop potential solutions. Social judgment skills relate to the refinement of potential \\nsolutions and the creation of frameworks for impl ementing solutions. Social skills are associated \\nwith motivating and directing others during the implementation of solutions. These skills are \\nacquired over time as levels of experience increas e, which means that the evolution from mere \\nmanager to leader occurs over the course of a career. \\nIn addition, the model assumes that certa in types of knowledge  are necessary to \\neffectively apply these leadersh ip skills – knowledge of the job, knowledge of the organization, \\nknowledge of the business, and knowledge of th e people (Mumford et al. 2000c). Therefore, \\neven the most charismatic and talented leader s are considered novices when they enter a new \\norganization, because they lack a true understand ing of the people in the organization and how to \\naccomplish work within the organization (Mumford et al. 2000a). Leaders progress from a novice level through an intermediate level to an expert level by gaining organizational \\nknowledge and acquiring increased competency in the three key leadership skills (problem-\\nsolving, social judgment, and social). \\nThe development of leadership skills from novice to expert is achieved through real life \\nexperience. It is assumed that novi ce leaders have a basic set of te chnical and social skills from \\nprior education or work experien ce that can be relied on to solve simple problems that are highly \\nstructured and well defined (Figure 1). As novice s gain organizational know ledge, they also need \\nto work on developing their leadership skills to reach the intermediate level.

According to  the skills-based model presented in Figure 1, there are several areas \\non which to focus leadership development programs.  Initial training on technical and social skills \\nis the first step in developing leaders. These skills are often gained in educational environments, and several researchers have addressed the issues surroundi ng leadership development in \\nengineering education (Bowma n and Farr 2000; Farr et al. 1997; McCuen 1999).

The most \\ncommon leadership development practice is formal training programs; however, the study \\nshowed that giving workers specia l projects or assignments as pa rt of their normal job is more \\neffective in developing successful leaders. Anot her missing element to leadership development \\nin many companies is a mentoring program. (Weinstein 2006) \\nApprenticeship programs are another successful  approach to leadership development. \\nApprenticeship programs combine technical e ducation with increasingly advanced work \\nexperiences, which allow workers to graduall y assume greater leadership roles. Although \\napprenticeship programs have declined in recent years, some companies are reviving them as a \\nmeans to develop future leaders. (Waxer 2006) \\nThe focus of leadership development research  can generally be grouped into one of two \\nareas – developing individual skills that are a ssociated with leaders (e.g., charisma, motivation, \\nintellectual stimulation) or developing inte rpersonal social relationships to encourage \\ncooperation (Day 2000). The first approach focuse s on developing individuals as “leaders” and \\nincludes research on transformational leadership  and charismatic leadership. These types of \\nindividual skills are hard to learn. The sec ond approach focuses on developing “leadership” \\nopportunities through relationships. The sk ill-based model developed by Mumford et al.  (2000c), \\nand described previously, focuses mostly on so cial skills as well as on individual problem-\\nsolving skills, both of which can be learned. For this reason, the sk ills-based model of leadership \\ndevelopment has been adopted for this study as th e initial framework for leadership development \\nprograms in construction organizations. \\n \\n \\n  \\nA Preliminary Training Model for Developing Construction Leaders \\n \\nDevelopment of leaders in construction or ganizations has traditionally followed an \\napprenticeship model where leadership skills ar e acquired through experi ences gained in the \\nconstruction workplace. Some companies augment apprenticeship programs to some extent by \\ntraining. Recent labor shortages and economic pr essures have forced some companies to \\nabandon formal apprenticeship programs in ex change for on-the-job training. Apprenticeship \\nprograms provide a good structure within which to  develop leadership skills. However, in the \\nabsence of a formal apprenticeship program, an  alternative approach is described in the \\nfollowing paragraphs.  \\nA training model for developing construction leaders should include  creation of a well-\\ndefined plan to shape the work experience of the employee by ensuring that the employee gains \\nappropriate learning opportunitie s supported by formal training. Leadership development should \\nbe based upon a well-defined plan starting at the level where an i ndividual is. The plan should be \\ndesigned to shape both the experi ence and the training to take the learner from a novice level ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

A mentor will help \\nthe novice move through the leadership plan  by providing direction and securing resources \\nnecessary for development.  \\nUpon entry into the leadership developmen t program, the novice should work with the \\nmentor (often the novice’s immediate supervisor) to  define where the novice is at that point in \\ntheir career and where they want to be. Based on the Skills-Based Model, a key element of the \\nprogram is to provide clearly defined job desc riptions and rolls for each step along the way. \\nNext, technical skills can be define d as the tools that the learner wi ll need to effectively execute \\nthe defined job at each step. T echnical training can then be de veloped to provide the desired \\ntechnical skills. Within the c ontext of the technical training, social skills such as oral \\ncommunication, problem solving and critical thinking can be integr ated through workshop \\nactivities and practical exercises.  These skills would then be re inforced and applied through work \\nexperiences. A unique characteristic of leadership skills is that they are difficult to teach in a \\nvacuum, but can often be incorporated into t echnical training and th rough work experience. \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nThe preliminary training model for developing  construction leaders presented in this \\npaper is based on a Skills- Based Model of leadership  development.

These work assignments can be \\nsupplemented by technical training to ensure that the employee ha s the required technical skills. \\nThe goal of the training program is to move the em ployee from a novice leader state to an expert \\nleader state. \\n Further definition of the model for leader ship development prog rams in construction \\norganizations is currently underway. The aut hors are conducting a survey of entry-level \\nemployees in construction organizations to iden tify what type of work environment they are \\nexposed to and whether that environment is consistent with the Skills-Based Model presented in this paper. After the survey and subsequent refinement of the trai ning model, the authors plan to \\nconduct a demonstration case study to evaluate the training model in an actual construction \\norganization. Based on observations from the case study, a final framework will be developed. \\n \\nAcknowledgements  \\n \\nThe authors would like to thank the followi ng companies for providing information for \\nthis paper: Jaynes Corporation, RMCI, Inc. and Albuquerque Underground, Inc. \\n \\n \\n   ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The candidates’ “paper credentials” pl ay central roles in each candidate’s success in \\nbeing hired.  However, individual core values, peop le skills, competencies, and leadership traits of \\nthe candidates are usually not addressed directly, a nd in many cases, not indirectly, in the hiring \\nprocess.  The faculty member’s leadership ability and leadership experiences  play central roles in \\neach faculty's member’s career successes.  In  reviewing evaluation processes and forms, \\nleadership is seldom mentioned and if leadership is mentioned it is undervalued.   \\n \\nKey Words:  Construction Education, Faculty Hiring, Faculty Profiling, Faculty Ranking and \\nFaculty Evaluations, Leadership  \\n \\nIntroduction \\n \\nTo quote an old management saying, “You are hired for your technical skills, fired for your lack \\nof people skills, and promoted for your leadership  and management skills.”  The purpose of this \\npaper is to address how important leadership skills are to faculty recruitment and career success. \\n This paper uses the term “construction programs”  to include all programs of construction in \\nhigher education, including construction ma nagement, construction science, building \\nconstruction, construction engineerin g, etc.  The authors realize this  is a very controversial topic \\nand anticipate that this paper will be a vehi cle to initiate and conduct academic debates.  \\n The academic discipline of construction is a bl end of technology, engineering, management, and \\nconstruction. Construction programs of higher education evolved duri ng the last century; \\nhowever, academia has been slow in realigni ng supporting programs to meet the growth of \\nconstruction programs which reflect the needs of the construction industry.  The transformation \\nis underway, but the pipeline of qualified constr uction faculty has not yet been established.  \\nFaculty members are being recruited from the crossover disciplines—eng ineering, architecture, \\neducation, etc.  The ability of  multi-disciplined faculty to deliver a construction curriculum \\ncreates both a richness of divers ity and a forum for conflict.   \\n A few years ago one of the author’s academic programs had a consultant/facilitator assess the \\nfaculty and senior staff in profili ng their preferred work style. The results were interesting in that \\nthe majority of the faculty were classed as inde pendent workers/creative t ypes with great affinity \\nfor task and details.  Only six of the 40 were in  the leader/manager category with a big picture \\nfocus with an affinity for leadership over ma nagement. All were successful faculty and knew \\nthemselves, and were content with the academic  careers.  The authors recognize that the \\nacademic career may be a superb choice for th e independent worker, but are concerned about \\ncreating a pipeline of future program leaders from  this group.

Consequently, in succession planning, leadership became a priority in one author’s school.

A series of leadership developm ent discussions and seminars were conducted.  \\nLeadership books were introduced and discussions of principles of leadership were held.  \\nAdditionally, an investment in annual faculty development education a nd training on leadership \\nwas incorporated.

Comp etency can be defined as having the minimum \\nknowledge and skill to satisfactor ily perform. The Waller paper describes a competence model \\nfor project managers that attempts to include not only knowledge and skill, but further expands \\nthe model to include intellectual and moral behavior s in concert with the project manager's style.  \\nThe authors feel that construction education ha s to move to a competency model for faculty \\nmembers. \\n \\nAs written by (Bigelow 2003), putting the right project manager on the right job is what \\ncompetency assessment is all about! Competency is a buzzword in the new millennium, but what \\ndoes it mean? Why would an organization want to evaluate project manager competency? \\nProjects are only as successful as the peopl e who manage them. Evaluating project manager \\ncompetency enables organizations to identify individuals who are, or  have the potential to \\nbecome, superior project managers and determin e what is needed in the way of coaching and \\ndevelopment to raise performance.  \\nAccording to (Dainty 2004), the role of competency-based perfo rmance management is growing \\nin significance in many industries and sectors.  The research identifies 12 core behavioral \\ncompetencies that underpin effective projec t management performance, of which, two – \\n'composure' and 'team leadership' – were the most predictive. The authors be lieve this is true in \\nacademia.  \\nHiring the Right People  \\n \\n“Good to Great” (Collins, 2003) is a well read ma nagement book and is based on solid research \\nregarding how a good company can become a great company.  The authors feel that Collins has captured some of the concepts in his book for making academic programs great.  In chapter 4, Collins emphasizes that level-5 leadership, the top leadership which he identifies, first gets the \\nright people on the bus in the right seats and once th e right team is in plac e, then they figure out \\nthe best path to greatness.  One Jim Collins quo te that stands out is: “Those who build great \\ncompanies understand that the ultima te throttle on growth for any great company is not market or \\ntechnology or competition or product.  It is one thing above all othe rs; the ability to get and keep \\nenough of the right people.” \\nBadger and Smith (2005) state that the first guid ing principle in creati ng a world-class academic \\nprogram is to hire and keep highly qualified a nd motivated faculty.  In some academic circles \\ndeans will decide what direction the departme nt will go and will only authorize hiring faculty \\nwith targeted skill sets.  This seems to be especia lly true in deans who have a priority on research \\nand a lower priority on teaching.  The customers,  the construction industry, value teaching more \\nthan research, and in most hiring cases, admi nistrators have to face the dilemma of finding \\ncandidates with a Ph.D. and an affinity for re search or a candidate with good construction \\nexperience and a desire and capability to teach. \\nBadger and Smith (2004) contend that the true measure of an y construction program is the \\nquality of the individual faculty  members.

Great faculty members have \\noutstanding classes and their students become out standing alumni.  The ch allenge is that the \\nfaculty members do not generally want to be eval uated and compared with their peers or peer \\nprograms.  There are many metrics--student teac hing evaluations, the chair’s exit interviews, \\npublication records, research dol lar expenditures, and results of the CPC exams assessments--\\nwhich could be used to rank faculty members, but  few programs, have the desire, capability, or \\ndata to do this type of evaluation and ranki ng, nor can they stand the heat if they do. \\n  \\nFaculty Competence   \\n \\nAccording to one study (Walsh 1996), formal interv iews are the best oppor tunity for a candidate \\nto demonstrate their oral skills.  Is the inte rviewee poised doing the in terview?  Were they \\narticulate and confident? The oral communication abilities of faculty candidates become evident \\nduring the interview visits and the typically requ ired presentation of a c onstruction topic to the \\nfaculty. \\nValues   \\nThe Walsh study states: “…most people are awar e of their own value system; however, many \\npeople deceive themselves and try to convince themselves that th eir values lie elsewhere”.  A \\nperson’s value system is one of the most diffi cult things to change.  Therefore, knowing your \\nown values and the values of others working with you can be  advantageous in developing \\npersonal and team relationships. \\nProfessional Testing \\nBernstein & Kaye (1993) have created an instrument  to evaluate an individual’s values.  This \\ninstrument asked the person being tested 35 ques tions.  Values give meaning to life and work \\nand provide personal development.  Knowing the valu es that are most essential is an enabler in \\nmaking the good choices.  The good news  is there a wide variety of values to choose from; the \\nbad news is that you can’t have them all.  The instrument asked the person being evaluated to \\nselect the seven values that are most meaningful to them out of 35.  It forces the individual to \\n“value” profile themselves.  \\nThe authors realize that determining core valu es will probably be accomplished in discussions \\nwith the candidate’s references.  Additionally, more discussions with the candidate’s industry \\ncolleagues about core values and reputation are critical. \\n \\nWork Style Profile \\n \\nEveryone has a tendency to work according to a preferred work pattern or work style.  For \\nexample, one person may be task-oriented, while a nother is only concerned with the big picture.  \\nOne person may be result-oriented, while anothe r may wish to investigate issues thoroughly.  \\nThese two examples are rather diverse pairs.  However, there is no reason they cannot work \\ntogether on a project or as a f aculty team.  By knowing how each member of a team prefers to \\nwork, compromises can be made to work effectiv ely as a team without destructive conflict.

Misalignment of a pe rson's work style preference to the work style \\nrequirement of their position may result in personal  and organizational stress.  It may be unwise \\nfor an employer to select a task-o riented person for a big picture job. \\n Several inventories are available in a self-graded format for individuals to determine their preferred work styles.  Two such surveys, Mc Flechor’s Work Style pr eference inventory and \\nPadgett Thompson’s personal profile systems are ava ilable.  The McFlecher instrument has been \\nsuccessfully administered and correlated with construction professionals  by Badger and Warner \\n(1991).   \\nMyers-Briggs \\n \\nThe use of the Myers-Briggs Type I ndicator ® instrument\\n and the Strong Interest Inventory ® \\ninstrument  or other similar tests can help both organizations and individuals make better \\ndecisions regarding suitable  careers and job placement. \\n \\nHiring New Faculty \\n \\nThe Process \\n \\nMost faculty searches are accomplished by \\ncasting a big net—the bigger the better—and hoping that something swims in.  Once positions are approved by the institution, an advertisement is broadcast widely, usually on the ASC and ASCE web site, the obligatory EEO outlets, and frequently in ENR.  Applications are received and evaluated or ranked and visits are offered to the best candidates.  Visits are brief and perfunctory, references  may or may not be \\nchecked, and a hiring decision is made.  Usually a faculty search committee administers this pr ocess, making hiring \\nrecommendations to program leaders or the deans.   \\n \\nThe Four Circle Model  \\n \\nThe Four Circle Model was developed by the au thors in a previous wo rk (Badger and Smith, \\n2006).  The authors realized that in the academic  hiring process, faculty candidates are profiled \\nand ranked by faculty and administrators.  By de veloping a Four Circle Model to display the \\nthree layers of an individual’s credentials that surrounds their core  values, it is hop ed that a better \\nframework for the hiring process can be descri bed.  The authors have designated the center, \\nCircle One, as the candidate’s core values; Circ le Two represents the can didate’s interpersonal \\nskills; Circle Three identifies the hidden, invisible, and unmenti onable topics that come into 1234\\nApparent Credential\\nUnmentionables\\n& Intangibles Factors\\nInterpersonal Skills Core Values\", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Health : The candidate that is over weight, smokes, or has health  problems is usually avoided \\nas a poor return on investment.  \\n3. Reputation : The un-programmed phone calls to determ ine the ability of a candidate to work \\nwithin the team, moral and ethica l behavior, and legal profiles are critical but never talked \\nabout. \\n4. Ability to be a role model component in the program:  the stability, capability, and successful \\ntrack record to work in close proximity with students without crossing the boundary is \\nimportant but, again, never talked about. \\n5.  Failure on previous jobs : any faculty that was not tenured at one university will not be a \\nserious candidate at the next university. \\n6. Misconceptions:  the idea and perception that an indus try professional can retire, tell war \\nstories, and play golf needs to be ferreted out,  and the brutal fact of  how difficult being a full-\\ntime university educator can be must be comm unicated.

It is \\nunsettling to have the paradox of being politically correct but una ble to state what is really \\nwanted.  In public, the faculty members work on Ci rcle Four, when what is really needed is the \\nrecognition that the really important thi ngs are in Circles One, Two, and Three. \\n \\nBadger and Smith (2006) state that  clearly, hiring construction f aculty is very difficult and is \\nbecoming more so as universities raise the minimu m credentials.  Additionally, fewer and fewer \\nfaculty hires are from U.S. gra duate programs, which indicate that U.S. schools are not meeting \\nthe faculty needs of domestic construction programs.  The absence of a pool of young, PhD \\nholding applicants indicates a severe problem filling construction positions in the future.  While international hires and hires from outside the discipline can fill some of the positions, the \\ninability to hire PhD’s in the specific field debilitates construction programs drastically, which \\nnegatively affects future recru itment of both students and faculty.  Leadership or leadership \\npotential, as a “skills-set” is missi ng in most hiring discussions. \\n \\nProposed Hiring Scorecard \\nBadger and Smith (2006) developed a hiring score car d, see Appendix A. It is  expected that there \\nwill not be agreement with the scored items or the scoring weights; however, the authors contend \\nthat the scorecard will assist programs in an anal ysis of candidates and reduce the likelihood that \\nkey discriminators will be overlooked.  Programs may want to develop their own scorecards and \\nweights; the candidate scorecard  in the Appendix can be used as a point of departure.  \\n \\nThe importance of faculty hires mandates that uni versities use as many screens and filters as \\npossible.  Investigative backgr ound checks, personality profile te sting, extensive verification of \\nwork experiences, and complete profiling and ranki ng should be required.  With the shortage of \\nqualified faculty candidates, some programs will feel th at they need to ‘lower  the bar’ to fill the \\nposition.  The dilemma that programs face is:  Hire  someone with imperfect  credentials and try \\nand force-fit that individual in to the program, or do not hire, struggle through an interim situation \\nfor a year, and begin the search again next year?  The demand for faculty is growing, the desired \\nfaculty credentials are becomi ng more demanding, and the faculty  candidate pool is extremely \\nlimited.    The academic hiring process is fraught with diffi culty.  Growing demand, continuously elevated \\ndesired credentials, and very li mited candidate development all combine to make hiring a ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These systems include— \\n• Student Course Evaluations.  Most universities require th at student evaluations be \\ncompleted for every course, every semester.  These evaluations are typically reduced to a \\n‘score’ which enable comparison with ot her faculty teaching similar courses. \\n• Student Exit Surveys.  A survey of graduating seniors is a normal assessment instrument \\nfor most universities.  One component of th is survey is an assessment or ranking of \\nfaculty performance.  Again this enables administrators to get a relative ranking of \\nfaculty performance. \\n• Annual Faculty Reviews.  Most universities require some  form of periodic faculty \\nperformance appraisal by administrators.  Th is performance appraisal is normally an \\nannual review and tells the faculty member where he/she stands against peers and/or \\nperformance expectations.  \\n• Promotion and Tenure.   The process of tenure and promotion is perhaps the most \\nrigorous of faculty ranking syst ems.  It includes an evalua tion of performance over time \\nwith the evaluation being accomplished by coll eagues in the university, by peers from \\noutside the university and by administrators. \\n• Peer Review.  Peer review is an important comp onent of the Tenure and Promotion \\nprocess and is also evident elsewhere when th e professional work of a faculty member is \\nevaluated in peer review of  their teaching and research—particularly when they publish \\nin peer-reviewed journals and conferences. \\n \\n \\nProposed Ranking System--Faculty Scorecard \\n \\nUsing 10 Guiding Principles and multiple verification measures, Badger and Smith (2006) proposed a faculty scorecard (see Appendix B) wh ich could be used as a component of the \\nAnnual Review process.  The scorecard might be  completed as a self-evaluation by the faculty \\nmember, or it might be completed by the administ rator and used as a disc ussion vehicle to guide \\nthe faculty member toward professional growth.  The authors’ preferred approach would be for \\nthe faculty member to complete  a self-evaluation of the scor ecard, and then in a face-to-face \\nreview session with the administrator, go over eac h metric and agree on a fi nal score and then set \\ngoals for the future to enhance the faculty me mber’s scores. The assignment of weights is \\narbitrary and is meant to convey a sense of the relative importance as perceived by the program; \\nit is expected that programs that adopt this process will choose to assign their own weights.  \\n \\nThe purpose of the Professional Growth section is  to address the leadership capability of the \\nfaculty member.  This category has four metrics.  Rankings in this area are often not included in \\nother scoring systems.  The authors feel these metrics are perhaps the most important and have \\nmore potential for impacting the faculty member’s performance and growth than the metrics in the teaching, research and service categories.

For a faculty member to achieve world class status, the faculty \\nmember needs to practice lifelong le arning or self-improvement annually.   Faculty \\ninternships have been a superb instrume nt to update faculty member’s industry \\nexperience.  Some programs feel that this industry experience s hould be updated every \\nfour years.  On the engineer side, the academic  discipline feels that doing research is all \\nthe updating needed.  Attending industry cla sses and seminars in construction, estimating, \\nscheduling, contracting, construction law, management, and leadership should be \\nencouraged.  Each faculty member should de velop a career training and education plan.  \\nAt one university, faculty members at the st art of the year prepare three-page annual \\nwork plans.  The director then allocates e ducation and training developmental funds once \\nthe plan has been reviewed. \\n• Mentorship  Whether faculty members like being role models and mentors to students \\ndoes not matter.  It seems to automatically be part of the job, and this should be \\nrecognized and rewarded.  Great teachers b ecome the leaders in the classroom.  Good \\npeople skills and positive relationships ar e needed between faculty members and \\nstudents, faculty members and industr y, and faculty members and university \\nadministrators.  Usually when surveys within  the university address the issue of advising \\nstudents, the faculty member’s ability as a ro le model and mentor surfaces.  Construction \\nfaculty members have to be advisers on academic matters, career planning, and during \\nthe job search time frame upon graduation.  It appears that construction faculty members \\nperform better than the average university  professor in teaching and advising.   \\n• Collegiality.  Getting along in a friendly and collegia l fashion is the hallmark of an \\nexcellent faculty member.  Tolerance for the vi ews and opinions of othe rs is essential.  A \\ncritical component of any construction program  achieving excellence is the ability of the \\nfaculty members to work together as a team .  The greatest problem any program can have \\nis when the faculty members are divided in to cliques and fight among themselves.  To \\nachieve world class status requires that faculty  members to become team players.  It is \\nvery difficult to measure loyalty, the ability to work within the team, and how to be a \\nsupportive colleague.  Faculties need to c onduct “think tank” sessions on how to make \\nthis happen within the program.  \\n• Participation.  Faculty members have responsibilitie s to participate in department, \\ncollege and university activities.  Attending and participating in activities such as \\ngraduation, social events, faculty meetings , committee meetings, and student activities \\nare all part of a faculty member’s obligations.  The best faculty members will always participate actively.  \\n \\nWhether we realize it or not, facu lty members are ranked continuously  and leadership is a hidden \\nmetric.  Students evaluate them each semester when they teach.  They are evaluated annually \\nwhen raises are allocated.  However, the majo r ranking occurs when faculty apply for tenure and \\npromotion.  As the academic discipline of construction ma tures, faculty should understand the profiling and \\nranking systems.  The administrators need to de velop skills in profili ng and ranking.  There are \\nhuman resources professionals that  have developed techniques and methods that we in academia \\nneed to study.

The students’ work is actually graded by points established and \\nan official grade is awarded.  Academic administra tors do not seem to use any type of testing or \\nexams for their faculty.  One program has enc ouraged their faculty to take the Certified \\nProfessional Contractor Level II exam.  Others award cr edit for faculty members who obtain \\ntheir Professional Engineer license.  In most cas es the PE license requires a written exam and a \\ncommitment to lifelong learning.  \\nLeadership Development \\n \\nLeadership Development is a jour ney which needs constant attenti on.  Despite the age old debate \\nas to whether leaders are born, or whether lead ers can be taught, today’s leaders must be \\nconstantly preparing tomorrow’s leaders.  L eadership scholars advocat e leadership training, \\nblended with leadership opportunity, to better enable tomorrow’s leaders. \\n \\nMilitary Leadership Model \\n \\nIn general, the military has tiered training where en try-level, mid-level, and senior-level officers \\nare screened and the better perf ormers are selected to attend additional schooling.  Military and \\ncivilian school selection is performance based.  The military uses both its own schools run by the \\nmilitary and other opportunity, outso urced to civilian universities.  Approximately one-third of \\nthe military engineering officers ar e selected and funded for attendance at a civilian university to \\nobtain a Master’s Degree.  There is strong enco uragement to obtain a Professional Engineering \\nLicense.  Officers may serve a number of tours within the Facility Management area.

The graduate is hired to work in th e functional area of the de gree.  The challenge may \\nbe how graduates can keep the technical skills from decreasing over a career?  To maintain \\nproficiency of technical skills, the professional is encouraged to  adopt a concept of “life-long \\nlearning” and renew and refresh the technica l knowledge.  Without this refreshing, the \\nproficiency will decrease over a career.  A real professional will read, study, do in-house classes, seminars, and on-line technical assisted lear ning.  Many organizationa l training programs only \\nfocus on the technical skill subjects and do not properly address management and leadership.  Organization’s can adopt the ph ilosophy of “life-long learning”,  encouraging or requiring \\nemployees to join professional societies,  practice on-the-job training, and obtaining \\ncertifications. When employees practice life-long learning they can keep the technical skill line \\nslope relatively level and not cont inuing to decrease.

Some organizations recommend that the employees get an MBA degree, join professional societies, attend management seminars, and obtain the proper work experiences.  Many companies feel it is a good investment to reimburse employees for their university tuition.  The importance of providing a series of personal development opportunities builds professiona lism within the organization. All \\nthese training activities and job experiences s hould increase the employee’s management skill-\\nset.  When management is added to the technical  skills set, during a care er, the balance between \\ntechnical skills and management skills keep changing.  The peak on the management element \\nseems to appear at mid-career befo re leadership becomes dominant. \\n  \\nLeadership \\n \\nEmployees can become better \\nleaders from self-education, attending seminars, reading, watching, experience, and from having active organizational mentors.  Mentoring seems to be the most critical component.  It appears that it is relatively easy to train a manager, but extremely difficult to educate a leader.  Consequently, organizations appear to have ten times more managers than lead ers.  It is important to note that leadership \\nskills increase over a career as  the employee moves up the care er ladder.  Additionally, the \\nbalance between the other types of skills cha nge and the professional education, training, and \\ndevelopment programs need to appreciate this trend and incorporate it into the development \\nprogram.

To capture this wisdom an organization should initiate a knowledge transfer program. Wisdom seems to be gained from reading, life experiences, listening, observing, learning from mistakes and experimenting.  When wisdom is added, successful professionals will be balancing the different skills sets.  Organizations value these skill-sets differently.  Yet, they “Profile” the professor and help \\ndetermine how successful they will be in the fu ture.  Professional development programs should \\naddress all four elements of technical, manage ment, leadership, and wis dom, and the balance at \\ndifferent levels in the career development and to understand and appreciate the balancing \\ndifferences.   \\n \\nSummary \\n \\nThe leadership skills of faculty  members are important in gett ing hired, in achieving tenure and \\npromotions, and moving into a leadership role.  Academic programs do not seem to recognize, or \\ninvest significantly in the profe ssional development of  faculty.  The profiling and ranking using \\nleadership as a key indicator seems to be missing.  However, academic programs need to make the transition in to a leadership model and away  from the management focus only.  The balance \\nbetween technical, management, and leadership varies as faculty advance in careers.

As part of this initiative, in 2004, ASCE \\ndefined the Body of Knowledge  (BOK)  required of civil engineers as  a prerequisite for licensing \\nand defined two paths to attainme nt of the BOK: one requiring th e future engineer to obtain a \\nbachelor’s and a master’s degree in engineering or related disc iplines (B+M), and the other by \\nobtaining an ABET accredited bachelors in civil engineering and 30 credit hours of upper level \\nundergraduate or graduate course work (B+30). Examination of the second path raised the \\nchallenge of determining how the quality of the courses obtained through the B+30 path and \\nfulfillment of the BOK though this same path could be assured. This paper reviews the alternative approaches that coul d be taken to carry out this va lidation and details the approach \\ncurrently being examined by ASCE.  \\n \\nA Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge (BOK) \\n \\nToday’s world is fundamentally challenging the way civil engineeri ng is practiced.  Complexity \\narises in every aspect of projects, from pre-project planning w ith varied stakeholders to building \\nwith minimum environmental and community distur bance.  Addressing this increased complexity \\nwill require understanding and solving problems at the boundaries of traditional disciplines.  At \\nthe same time, reductions in credit hours requi red for graduation are making the current four-\\nyear bachelor’s degree inadequate formal acade mic preparation for the practice of civil \\nengineering at a profes sional level in the 21\\nst century.  (BOK Report 2004) \\n \\nIn keeping with the leadership role of civil engineers in the infrastructure and environmental \\narena and in protecting p ublic health, safety, and welfare, the Board of Direction of the American \\nSociety of Civil Engineers (ASCE) in 2004 adopted Policy Statement 465 supporting “ the \\nattainment of a Body of Knowledge for entry into the practice of civil engineering at a \\nprofessional level.”  The concept of a body of knowledge stems from the definitions of what constitutes a profession.  \\nScholars have found that a profession, at its ba se, requires its members to possess a specialized \\nbody of knowledge. In 2004, the ASCE Comm ittee on the Academic Prerequisites for \\nProfessional Practice (CAP\\n3) defined the  civil engineering BOK for the 21st century through 15 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The initial definition of the BOK was accomplished with the release of the 2004 \\nBOK Report.    \\nThe report, Civil Engineering Body of Knowledge for the 21\\nst Century, identified several \\npaths to attainment of the BOK.  The BOK could be fulfilled by obtaining a Bachelor’s \\ndegree plus either a Master’s or approxima tely 30 acceptable credits & experience (“B + \\nM/30 & E”) (Figure 2).  The “E” in “B + M/30 & E” refers to progr essive, structured \\nengineering experience which, when combin ed with the educational requirements,  results in \\nattainment of the requisi te Body of Knowledge.

Alternative Paths to BOK Validation \\n \\nThe committee believes that most of those seeking the BOK likely will follow the traditional \\npath of matriculation at institutions of higher learning, or through distance learning programs \\nfrom those institutions.  Others may choose to attain the BOK through a combination of \\ncampus-based education and courses o ffered by non-traditional providers. \\n \\nNon-Traditional Providers \\nThere are many organizations offering post-gradua te professional education.  Universities \\noffer non-degree and certificate prog rams that include a large number of courses that would \\nbe relevant to attainment of the BOK.  As  the requirements for continuing professional \\ndevelopment (CPD) have been mandated for re -licensing of engineers and the profession in \\ngeneral has encouraged life-long learning, ma ny for-profit and non-profit organizations, \\ngovernment agencies and engineering firms ar e offering both CPD and the equivalent of \\nupper level undergraduate and graduate level profes sional practice and/or  technical courses.  \\nAs an example, the US Army Corps of Engineers  (USACE) offers extensive professional \\ndevelopment opportunities through its Pr oponent-Sponsored Engineer Corps Training \\n(PROSPECT) Program.  For over 30 years the PROSPECT program has been offering \\ncourses worldwide to federal, state, or lo cal government employees.  Its instructors and \\ncourse developers are drawn from USACE headqua rters, divisions, districts, laboratories, the \\nPROSPECT Center and from universities and pr ivate firms and many of the courses offered \\nare in advanced technical and professional and professional practice areas.  A recent survey \\nof 2,000 members of USACE science and engineer ing professionals indicated that more than \\n80% of them have taken PROSPECT courses and believed that all or some of the courses \\nmatched college and university courses in quality  and rigor. In the future, these programs will \\nplay an important role in providing post-baccalaureate educ ation for civil engineers who \\npursue the BABET + 30 path.  There are others private organizations who offer similar type \\nclasses via a corporate university like CDM, Ea rth Tech, Inc., and othe rs.

Courses that are taken to obtain the 30 additional credits would be \\nlimited to technical courses and to non-techni cal courses relating to professional practice. \\nConfining the courses to the types that most practitioners are familiar with would, the \\ncommittee reasoned, greatly ease the challenge of  reviewing the courses to determine if they \\nare consistent with the BOK.  The committee th en sought to identify means to validate the \\nfulfillment of the post-baccal aureate educational requireme nts attained through these \\nalternative education providers.  \\nMeeting Prerequisites for Licensing \\n \\nThe current licensure system in most of the 56  US jurisdictions requires the possession of a \\nBachelor of Science in Engineering degree from a program accredited by the EAC of ABET, \\nor its equivalent, as a prerequisite for licensu re.  Special procedures have been established \\nwith engineers with degrees from foreign univer sities.  As additional engineering education \\nrequirements are adopted by licensing boards, th ey will have to develop means of validating \\nthe full attainment of the requisite  educational requirements.  The B+MABET approach will not \\nbe substantially different than the current pro cedure which requires only an ABET bachelors.  \\nThe challenge becomes how do Boards validate  the programs of indi viduals who obtain an \\nABET bachelor’s and complete 30 credit hours of  work beyond the standard bachelor’s either \\nfrom a university or from some ot her provider or from a combination of the two.  In the latter \\ntwo cases, not only must the quality of the educa tion be validated, but since such programs, \\nby their nature, are tailored to an  individual’s needs and time availability, there will be a need \\nto ensure that, taken together, the post-grad uate courses and the undergraduate program \\nfulfills the requisite BOK.   \\nValidating Providers and BOK Fulfillment \\n \\nLicensing boards need assurances that the cour ses offered by non-university organizations are \\nof a quality comparable to universities and to en sure that the 30 credit hour equivalents taken, \\nas a group, fulfill the requ ired educational component. Education’s long history in \\naccreditation clearly indicates that accrediting bodies do not accredit co urses; rather, they \\naccredit the programs that provide the course s and expect that the organizations offering \\nthese programs and their faculties will provide co urses that fully meet the required standards.  \\nBelieving that it would be neither feasible nor wi se to attempt to ‘accre dit’ individual courses \\nbeing offered to satisfy the needs of the +3 0 program, the committee focused on developing \\nmethods to accredit /approve entities that might offer such courses.   The committee reviewed \\na variety of organizations capable of either  validating the credentials of +30 program \\nproviders and/or reviewing c ourses taken to complete fulfillment of the BOK.  These \\norganizations included: \\n \\n• Universities or professional organizations.

While management and \\nleadership classes highlight the importance of knowing your workforce, fostering team \\nenvironments and empowering subordinates, fe w curriculums address the importance that \\nrace, gender and culture play in the workplace.  These factors are critical for construction \\nmangers entering the workforce today in superv isory roles, especially as graduates from \\nUS colleges and universities begin to perform an increasing amount of work in the global \\narena.  Couple this factor with the dramatic  change in the composition of the skilled labor \\npool, as more minority groups enter the industr y and it becomes even more critical that \\nthe next generation of construction managers and engineers possess th e skills required to \\ninteract, communicate and relate to the ch anging demographics of the workforce.  \\nRecognizing this need, an elective course was developed within the Del E. Webb School \\nof Construction that highlights the importance  of these characteristics.   The course \\nexamines those issues and forces that ha ve shaped today’s construction workforce \\nincluding the diversity of experiences a nd relations among gender, race, and culture. \\nStudents explore the construction workfor ce throughout history including the roles of \\nwomen and immigrant labor forces.  Goals of the class include shaping more aware \\nstudents that have developed a respect fo r those who build and an awareness of the \\ndifficulties associated with the social and political issues surroundi ng today’s construction \\nworkforce.  Additionally, students determine the forces at work that will shape and \\nimpact the future construction workforce a nd establish a life-long appreciation for the \\nworkers who constructed the projects that creat ed and sustain the fabric of society.  The \\nfocus of this paper is to define the need for a course of this nature and highlight the course \\ncontent and implementation.  It illustrates how  understanding the race, gender and culture \\nbehind a workforce can serve to improve leadership and management skills.

Th ese actions ensure your stakeholders have buy-\\nin to the mission and feel part of the team.  To accomplish these goals a leader must comprehend the culture of the people that compri se their team.  As the demographics of the \\nconstruction workforce continues to change, students graduating from construction programs \\nwill be required to work with diverse cultures.  Providing students with  the knowledge, skills \\nand abilities to effectively lead and manage the workforce of today is a responsibility of the \\neducation they receive.  Comprehending the hist ory and culture of a workforce is critical to \\neffective leadership, as it provides a basis for communication, the cornerstone of trust \\namongst a team.  Incorporating these skills into current construction curriculum is difficult.  \\nWith university demands of shrinking program  hours, accompanied by increasing industry \\npressures to offer more construc tion related courses, faculty are facing a difficult challenge to \\nprovide students with such basics as estimati ng, planning and scheduling, let alone the softer \\ninterpersonal skills.  This paper describes the development and implementation of an elective \\ncourse that seeks to meet the desires of st udents and industry, while meeting accreditation \\nand university requirements. \\nNeeds assessment \\nTo begin the development of the course entitled, “Workforce Issues: Race, Gender \\nand Culture in the Construction Industry” the cour se creators first assessed the need for such \\na course.  The areas investigated included thos e identified by students attempting to meet the \\nUniversity criteria and construction industry leaders. \\nThe first area investigated was the request of students faced with meeting the \\nuniversity requirements.  The Del E. Webb School of Construction (DEWSC) curriculum \\nincludes a lower level (100 or 200) and an upper level (300 or 400) humanities course to meet \\nArizona State University gene ral studies course requirement s.  These two courses must \\nsatisfy three awareness areas: (1) Cultural Diversity in the United States, (2) Global \\nAwareness and (3) Historical Awareness. \\nEach semester students request a construction rela ted class to fulfill these requirements.  The \\ncourse developers, while appreciating student de mands for a construction based course, also \\nappreciate the importance of gaining a perspective of cult ural diversity.  \\nThe reoccurring theme from industry leaders indicated that the communication skills \\nof students were lacking.  The feedback indicat ed that students were ex periencing difficulties \\nworking with labor forces on site , specifically related to their in terpersonal skills.    Industry \\nfelt that construction managers of the future must possess the skills required to interact, \\ncommunicate and relate to the changing demogra phics of the workforce.  Combining this \\ninformation, along with the request of the studen ts, the developers felt the need for a course \\nthat addressed the importance of race, gender and culture in the workforce was apparent and \\njustified.  Comprehending the issues, concer ns and motivational driving forces of the \\nworkforce leads to better communicati on and improved leadership abilities. \\n \\nCourse Development \\nWhen entering the construction industry as a new graduate from a construction \\nengineering or management progr am, students are faced with issu es that are unique to their \\ndiscipline.  How they relate to the individuals completing the work in the field is critical to \\nsuccess.  Realizing this fact, the intent of the course is to provide students with a greater \\nunderstanding of the workforce concerns, which can lead to changes and a greater awareness \\nof the problems in the industry.

The historical \\nreferences include case studies to highlight problems, issues and the establishment of how \\nsuccessful projects were lead by individuals wh o understood the needs of the workforce.  The \\nhistorical approach is used to illustrate the fact that issues within the workforce and the \\ncharacteristics of a successful leader have not  changed much over time.  With these examples \\nunder their belts, the course moves to a social  and cultural based approach focusing upon the \\nspecific concerns facing the workforce and how comprehension of these issues can lead to \\nbetter management. \\nTo develop the culture of construction  workers portion of the course, two \\nethnographic studies, Royal Blue, The Culture of Construction Workers , by Herbert \\nApplebaum and Hard Hats, The Work World of Construction Workers , by Jeffrey W. Riemer \\nare referenced.  These books highlight how wo rkers function on site, the unique nature of \\nconstruction work, the autonomy within the workplace and how construction workers view \\njob satisfaction. Emphasis is placed upon the fact that construction workers are bound to one \\nanother in work and family ne tworks that are exclusive, a nd they project relationships, \\nvalues, and norms from their work into their non- work lives.  Other cultural studies included, \\nHigh Steel – the Daring Men Who Built the World’s Greatest Skyline ,by Jim Rasenberger and \\nWe’ll Call You If We Need You-Experi ences of Women Working in Construction,  by Susan \\nEisenberg.  High Steel  depicts the lives of Ironworke rs in New York City and the \\ncontributions of differe nt ethnic groups to include the Ir ish, Swedes, Norwegians, and the \\nMohawk Indians from the Kahnawake Reservation.  We’ll Call You If We Need You  is an \\naccount of 29 women who entered construc tion trade unions across the US during the \\nAffirmative Action Era of the late 1970’s early 1980’s.  Other published literature, journal \\narticles, trades publications and governme nt publications are also referenced. \\nAnother major area of focus for the course  includes the changing demographics of the \\nlabor force of the future.  Students receive US Census Bureau information regarding the \\ninflux of immigrant workers into construction and information on how to attract and retain \\nworkers between the ages of 16 and 24, the la rgest growing age bracket in the workforce.  \\nSpecific issues of discussion include Hispanic  culture, language barrier issues and illegal \\nimmigration, based upon the major dem ographics of the local workforce. \\nPersonal experiences are drawn upon in course  implementation.  The developers each \\nworked in the trades or with the trades in bot h non-union and union sett ings at various levels \\nof leadership. One developer owned their ow n electrical contracti ng business in the \\nSouthwest and worked as an electrician in the Midwest.  The other, a daughter of Italian \\nimmigrants whose father and grandfather were  both union carpenters, worked as a field \\nproject manager on heavy-civil jobs thr oughout the Northeast and served as a civil \\nengineering officer in the Air Force.    \\nCourse Content \\n While it is not the intent of this paper to cover the entire course content, specific \\nsections where students are given tools to assi st in their progression into the construction \\nindustry are presented. \\nHistory of Construction in the United States \\nTo comprehend the functioning of a culture, be  it of a certain race, tribe, religion or \\nworkforce, you must understand the history that driv es that culture.  The course begins with a \\ndiscussion of the Carpenters’ Company of Ph iladelphia. The study of this group focuses upon \\nthe role of the Master Builder in colonial time s, and sets the stage for the structure of the \\nbuilding trades and practices still in place today.  Issues included formation of guilds, \\ndevelopment of legislation to protect local workers from foreign and domestic immigrant \\nworkers and the ancient tradition of sons follow ing the trade of their fathers.

The \\nintent is to highlight the fact that issues stud ents will be facing as  they enter the industry \\ntoday, have roots dating back to colonial times. \\nCase Studies \\nThe course uses monumental construction projects completed over the past century to \\nhighlight different working conditions, the treatm ent of the labor force,  the contribution of \\nimmigrant labor to the building of this country a nd the roles that each of these variables plays \\nin the completion of a project.  Each project chosen highlights a particular workforce issue \\nfaced by the project leadership and how th e lessons learned can be implemented on the \\njobsites of today. \\nThe Transcontinental Railroad offers insight into the use of immigrant labor to solve \\nlabor shortages problems and how different cultur es played a major role in the completion of \\nthe railroad.  The class addresses issues of how labor problems were solved by contracting \\nwith Irishmen from New York where labor was scarce, using captive Native American \\nIndians for the grading operations, the employ ment of men from the Union and Confederate \\nArmies, and the experimental usage of the Ch inese coolies. The project demonstrates how \\nmanagers and leaders must be willing to try ne w approaches to recruiting and retaining labor \\nforces.  The Panama Canal illus trated the disparity in the treatment of workers based upon \\nsocial status.  The project highlights the concep ts of non-stop work schedules, lack of concern \\nfor life, use of new innovations and the concept of  the work camp, with special attention paid \\nto the building of the Canal Zone.  The Cana l Zone was a development of communities to \\nhouse workers and their families whose fo cus was to maintain a happy and productive \\nworkforce.  The class explores the hierarc hy of the Canal Zone and the exploitation and \\nsegregation of the African-Amer ican workforce. Other projects used to illustrate cultural \\nissues among labor forces are the Alaska Highway and the Roosevelt Dam.  \\nCulture of the Construction Worker \\nOccupational socialization is a process th rough which a newcomer becomes a regular \\nmember of the group. In order to successfu lly manage and lead individuals, one must \\ncomprehend their concerns, how they view their work and what motivates them to perform.  \\nThe culture of a construction worker is unique an d the next phase of the course deals with the \\ncomprehension of that culture. The focus is on key concepts that wi ll aid new graduates in \\nbecoming better leaders and successful, respecte d managers. This includes race and gender \\nissues within all levels of the construction workforce.   \\nConstruction projects are work environm ents where people work amongst equals – \\nthose who have mastered the tools, materials and techniques of their trades. The course \\ndiscusses the importance of respecting the know ledge, skills and abilities of the worker.  \\nQuestioning the knowledge and abilities of a work er in a demeaning manner or in front of an \\nentire crew is a sure way to alienate yourself from your workfo rce.  New graduates, leaders \\nand management should never pass up the opportun ity to listen to the worker’s approach to \\nwork and respect their level of experience.  Th e class enforces that respecting this concept \\nwill also help to improve relationship s between management and trades.   \\nIn construction, people work in teams, gangs , or pairs.  One must not only cooperate \\nwith one’s immediate gang, but must coordinate  with other trades.  Each craftsperson has a \\nsense of the totality of the structure and the part that each plays in creating it.  Therefore, all trades share in the pride of creating something new and the part that each played.  The course \\ndiscusses this concept with a focus on allowing superintendents to sel ect their crews and how \\ncareful consideration must be given when integrating new employees into the system, \\nespecially women and minorities.   \\nDiscussion of the core values within the construction worker culture revolves around \\nthe pride they take in their work.

They feel they produce something real and tangible.  They \\nsee physical evidence of what they accomplish  and that gives testim ony to the integrity of \\ntheir work.  Self-respect is quite important  among construction workers.  The class \\nemphasizes this concept and discussion is cent ered upon how these characteristics drive the \\nconstruction worker to perform. \\nLeadership on construction sites has nothing to do with formal leadership positions.  \\nThe individuals on construction projects w ho occupy formal leadership positions may \\ncommand little respect if they are willing to ma nipulate and lie to prot ect their own personal \\npositions.  Those who enjoy their own self-respect and that of ot hers exercise leadership for \\nthe benefit of others.  The course discusses that as a manager, being willing to run the risk of \\nfailure and criticism by taking personal charge of  a difficult situation will earn more respect \\nthan any title on a business card.  The real leaders, in the eyes of the construction worker, are \\non the job solving construction problems (Applebaum, 1981) \\nConstruction workers traditionally enjoy phys ical sports and socialization off the job \\nis important.  They like to tell stories, to kid around and comic stunts  are regular occurrences \\non projects.  They also enjoy jobsite lunches and off-site picnics during which they can \\nsocialize in a more informal manner.  Thes e activities contribute to group cohesion and \\nproduce in the workers feelings of fellowship  and affinity.  The course discusses these \\nactivities as important areas where a manage r can influence the attitude, quality and \\nperformance of work, by supporting these even ts.  Monthly jobsite luncheons are great \\nmotivational tools and can serve as a time to  recognize safety, exceptional performance and \\nas a time for controlled “horseplay.”  A ma nager who shuns these ac tions as non-productive, \\nultimately disrupts the core of wh at makes the worker perform.   \\nA critical area the course address is the language of the jobsite.  A manager must \\ncomprehend the jargon used on the sites as it binds the workforce culture. Not \\ncomprehending this is a critical flaw of many ne w graduates, managers a nd apprentices alike.  \\nIf you can talk the talk, you will be mo re easily accepted amongst the group.   \\n Other issues of discussion relate to worker  performance and the sense of job security.  \\nConstruction workers are aware that their careers and the longevity of their employment \\ndepend on their performance.  Feedback is importa nt to workers, but must be accomplished in \\na respectful manner.  Managers must also realize that the sense of insecurity that surrounds \\nthe entire industry is one of the basic elements of the way of life of construction workers.  \\nWhile most managers will move back to a home office or to another job, construction \\nworkers facing a lay off may be left unemployed,  without a source of income to provide for \\ntheir families.  The class discusses ways mana gers can schedule work to allow for optimum \\nemployment and how to provide motivation to main tain productivity until job completion.   \\nRace and Gender \\nThis section of the course highlights issu es that face women and minorities and how \\nby comprehending these concerns, mangers can more successfully help these individuals \\nsucceed while completing their projects.  A larg e number of construction projects require the \\nhiring of a certain percentage of women and mi norities and meeting these goals is a pressure \\nthat leaders will face.  At times, the discussi on in the classroom while addressing these issues \\nbecomes heated, but these topics are critical for managers to comprehend. \\nBoth women and ethnic minorities face ma ny of the same issues when entering the \\nconstruction workforce.  Based upon the culture di scussed above, one of the key elements in \\nconstruction is the pattern of personal relations hips in the work process. The use of small \\ncrews and the familiarity amongst the workers, do es not openly invite outsiders into the work \\nprocess.  Managers must strategically in troduce these minorities into work crews and \\nunderstand that they may not be welcome.

They feel a sense of alienati on when first arriving \\non the jobsite.  They must earn the respect of th e individuals on the jobsite and feel an intense \\npressure to perform.  This visibility of race minorities and women within the construction \\nfield is a critical issue that leaders must comp rehend.  While the industry is apt to accept a \\nmediocre performance from a white male as a re flection of the individual, when a female or \\nminority fails it is a reflec tion upon their whole gender or ra ce (Bilbo and White, 1999).   \\nWhile Asians are the fastest growing ethnic minority in the US, the Hispanic \\npopulation is represented to a larger degree in the construction industry (BLS, 2003).  \\nConstruction managers working with Hispanic  labor forces not only face a language barrier, \\nbut a cultural one as well.  The course specif ically addresses the issues that are valued by \\nHispanic workers.  These include the importa nce of family and providing for them, the \\nintense work ethic they demonstrate, the ma le machismo, and the manner in which they \\ndisplay loyalty and respect to each  other.  It is not uncommon fo r an entire crew of Hispanic \\nworkers to leave a job if a member of their crew is laid off.   \\nWomen in construction face a number of issu es that managers can help alleviate by \\ncomprehending their importance.  The course addresses issues of sexual harassment, the \\nimportance of family, equal pay for equal work , physical ability to perform work, and the \\nglass ceiling concept.  The class discussions  centered upon the inclusion of women and how \\nto embrace their skills, ideas and contributi ons as positives, versus a confrontational \\napproach.  Issues commonly raised by wome n such as safety and jobsite hygiene are \\ndiscussed with an emphasis placed upon the fact that these are concerns of all construction \\nworkers, not just women.   \\nImplementation of the Course \\nThe course was conducted in a discussion based style.  Stud ents were responsible for \\nreading information relating to the topic prior to  class and expected to come to class ready to \\ndiscuss the information.  Some  students found this method inti midating at first and quizzes \\nwere often required to stimulate student intera ction.  As the semester progressed, students \\nbegan to participate in lively discussions relating the class to pic to their personal experiences \\non worksites.  By far the most heated discussi ons within the class arose when discussing the \\ninclusion of minorities and women in the cons truction workforce, the roles of labor unions \\nand language barriers  faced on site.   \\nTheir grade in the class was compri sed of three components, classroom \\ndiscussion/quiz participation, a re search paper and an oral presen tation of the findings of their \\nresearch.  The research paper was to be an ethnographic study of a facet of the construction \\nindustry workforce.  Examples of topics that st udents chose included: The Role of Unions in \\nthe US Construction Industry; Construction Labor Force of the Hoover Dam, Italian \\nImmigrants in the US construction workforce;  The Culture of Ironworkers and Recruiting \\nWoman into the Construction Workforce. \\nAssessment/Feedback – Course ratings \\nThe course was piloted in the Fall 2005 semester to a class of 28 students and 33 \\nstudents in the Winter 2005 session.  In order to  evaluate the class, the developers used the \\nstandard Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering online course evaluation system.

E. H. Anumba¹, A. R. J. Dainty², S. G. Ison³ and A.

Existing approaches to construction labour market plan ning have several limitations. \\nIn particular, they are inadequate in providi ng the construction industry with data on the \\nspatial distribution of skilled workers, demand spots, and training facilities. This paper \\npresents the implementation and evaluation of a GIS-based system for proactive construction \\nlabour market planning. It starts with a brief re view of the nature of labour market planning \\nin construction, introduces geographic informat ion systems, and highlights the opportunities \\nthey offer for overcoming the limitations of existing approaches to construction labour \\nmarket planning. The implementation of the GIS-based system and its application to a \\nspecific labour market planning initiative are th en presented. The evaluation of the system by \\nprospective end-users is also covered in the pape r, with details of the enablers, barriers and \\nbenefits of the system implementation. Organi sational issues that had a bearing on the \\nimplementation are highlighted. The concluding part of the paper explores the potential for \\ndeployment of the system to address a wide r range of labour market planning issues. \\n \\n1. Introduction \\nLabour Market Planning (LMP) is a referenc e planning for the future needs of an \\norganisation or an industry’s workforce. Lync h (1982) identifies two aims of corporate labour \\nmarket planning, namely to ensure the optimum  use of the personnel currently employed, and \\nto provide for the future staffing needs of the enterprise in terms  of skills, numbers and ages. \\nThe United Kingdom construction industry due to  the boom of the past years is facing many \\nchallenges in trying to plan for its labour mark et and ensure that there are enough skilled \\nworkers to meet its future needs. Some of these challenges include locating where \\nconstruction activity is growing, establishing wh at skills will be needed by the workforce in \\nthe future and what programmes are in place to develop these skills.   \\nTo help the industry address such issues it is important that agen cies and stakeholders \\nresponsible for the employment and training needs of the industry work together and use their \\nrespective information resource s jointly. Strategic organisati ons such as the Learning and \\nSkills Council (LSC) and the Construction In dustry Training Board ConstructionSkills \\n(CITB) can pull their information resource together  to help determine issues such as where in \\nthe country there is ongoing construction activity , what numbers need to be added to the \\nworkforce what skills they need to be trained in to combat skills shortage.  \\n¹ Researcher,  Centre for Innovative and Collaborative Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough, LE11 3TU \\n² Senior Lecturer, Department of Civil and Buildin g Loughborough University, Loughborough, LE11 3TU \\n³ Lecturer, Department of Civil and Building Loughborough University, Loughborough, LE11 3TU \\n4 Regional Strategy Adviser, CITB ConstructionSkills, Be lton Road Industrial Estate, Loughborough, LE11 5TB \\n \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

GIS has \\nthe capability of processing high proportions of geographic data. It has been claimed that as \\nmuch as 90% of business data is geographic data (Grimshaw, 1993). GIS provides a way of \\ninvestigating the geographical dimension of inte rnal and external data. A substantial amount \\nof data collected and used by the industry generally have a geographic dimension. GIS \\nthrough its integrative nature can contribute to the construction labour market planning \\nprocess by combining disparate labour market  information efficiently, thereby placing \\nanalysts in a better position to unde rstand specific spatial patterns.  \\n \\nThis paper demonstrates briefly the use of GIS in construction LMP by looking at a GIS \\napplication that has been used in the implem entation of a labour mark et planning initiative, \\nand discusses the impact of the system on the organization. The paper st arts by discussing the \\nconstruction industry, showing its unique make up and current state. It then goes on to \\nintroducing GIS and  examining it as a Decision  Support System (DSS) and how it has been \\nused in LMP to contribute to the decision maki ng process of an organization. The paper then \\nexplains the evaluation process of the GIS app lication that has been mentioned and analyse \\nthe results. It discusses how the application ha s integrated not only a process, but also the \\npeople responsible for that process at an orga nizational level. It also shows the wider \\npotential of the system in planning the i ndustry’s future labour force. The paper then \\ndiscusses the limitations of the existing en vironment within the organization that has \\nimpacted the effectiveness of the system.  \\n \\n3. CURRENT LABOUR MARKET PLANNING IN CONSTRUCTION \\n \\nThe UK construction industry provides a tent h of the UK's gross domestic product, & \\nemploys 1.4 million people. It is one of the st rongest in the world, with output ranked in the \\nglobal top ten (DTI, 2005). After the US, the UK  has the second highest level of construction \\nvalue added per capita (CITB, 2004). The constr uction industry is unique when compared to \\nother industries in its make up. In 2001 there were 168,123 construction contractors operation \\nin Great Britain who produced output valued at £74.6 billion and employed 973,600 workers \\n(CITB, 2002). An additional 600,000 workers are estimated to be self employed. Planning for \\nthe future of the workforce of such an industr y can be very difficult and challenging. Thus it \\nis vital that appropriate strategi es are put in place that can help to alleviate problems such as \\nskills shortage which the industry is suffering from now (Delargy 2001, Crates 2001, CITB Skills Survey 2003). The current labour market context presents severa l challenges for those \\nwith responsibility for labour market planning.  This includes predicting how many workers \\nwill be needed in the next five years, what skills will they require and where in the country \\nwill they be needed. These questions can only be answered through labour market forecasting \\nand planning activities. Accordi ng to Gritzioyis & Stoll, (2002) this enables the industry to: \\n \\n¾ Develop better human resource strategies \\n¾ Better determine future human resource requirements \\n¾ Create more targeted training programs \\n¾ Provide more base-line inform ation for labour relations \\n¾ Give employers and workers a competitive edge \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Aggregate in dustry forecasts are those produced by \\norganisations such as the CITB the Department  of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the Learning \\nand Skills Council etc. This involves the w hole industry and are for public consumption. The \\nforecast model being used by CITB at present was originally develope d by the Institute for \\nEmployment Research (IER); this has now be en modified and redeveloped by Business \\nStrategies. The present version of the m odel takes into account regional output and \\nunemployment data but it uses fixed proporti ons for determining the share of regional \\nemployment across the 22 construction sector occ upations. The key input statistic that drives \\nthe CITB model is the assumed rate of annu al output growth in th e construction sector \\n(Business Processes Resource Centre, 2000). This  is populated by a range of labour market \\ndatasets from the Labour Force Survey, output  figures from the Department of Trade and \\nIndustry, output growth predic tions from forecasting agencies and training supply data \\nmeasured from surveys of formal training pr ovision. The model is also informed by an \\nemployers’ skills needs survey and expert opinion from academics and forecasters. The \\nresulting forecast provides a cumulative growth  requirement based on a variety of growth \\nscenarios, which are subsequently disaggrega ted to individual geographical regions. The \\noutput of the model can be furt her informed by other econometric forecasts. Other groups \\nsuch as the Institute for Employment Researc h at Warwick University produce construction \\nemployment forecasts as part of a national economy-wide forecasting exercise. Company \\nlevel forecasts are those produced by individual  firms to suit their individual objectives and \\nare considered the property of the company.  These are generally not made public and so \\nrarely taken into account regi onal and national forecasts. \\n \\nDespite the success of the econometric models they do not shed light on the socio economic issues that the problems faced by th e industry \\nsuch as the sectors recruitment and skills shortages are usually grounded in. For example, a certain geographical area might be  suffering \\nfrom recruitment problems linked to a particular upsurge in activity, but the present models are unlikely to shed little light on the \\ncomplexities realities of local and regional labour market pressures that are affecting these areas. There is a demand for more  appropriate \\ndecision-support mechanisms that can take account of geographic problems in terms of skills demand and supply influences. The r ecent \\naccession of Eastern European countries to the EU has further complicated the situation as it is unclear how many qualified wor kers this \\nwill lead to the medium and long term. \\n \\n4. GIS as Decision-Support Systems \\nA decision support system (DSS) is a computer based system that helps the decision maker \\nutilise data and models to solve unstructur ed problems (Sprague a nd Carlson 1982). DSS aid \\nmanagers to make decisions that are unique, ra pidly changing and not easily specified in \\nadvance. They address problems where the pro cedure for arriving at a solution may not be \\nfull predefined in advance. By design they have  more analytical power than other information \\nsystems. They are built explicitly with a variety of models to analyse data, or they condense \\nlarge amounts of data into a form where they can be analysed by decision makers (Laudon & \\nLaudon, 2002).  \\n \\nDecision-Support Systems are designed so that users can work with them directly, they \\ninclude user-friendly software. They are interactive in that the user can change assumptions, \\nask new questions and include new data. Geog raphical information systems are a special \\ncategory of DSS that can analyse and displa y data for palling and decision making using \\ndigitised maps. The software can assemble store, manipulate and display geographically \\nreferenced information, tying data to points, li nes, and areas on a map. GIS can thus be used \\nto support decisions that require knowledge ab out the geographic dist ribution of people or ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The \\nQuery feature allows the user to  view different scenarios by as king questions such as: What \\nare there? Why are they there? What will ha ppen if? What might ha ppen if? These different \\nscenarios give valuable understanding of issues to decision makers when planning for the \\nfuture.  \\n Figure 1 illustrates the basic co mponents of a GIS. This illustrates that both attribute and \\nspatial data are collected. Inputting the data  into a computer-based information system \\nrequires that the data is reconfigured appropri ately before it is inputted and stored in the \\nsystem. A substantial amount of data collect ed and used by the industry has a geographic \\ndimension (see Maloney and Kowalchuk.1993) and so it can be  applied to a large number of \\ncomplex data management problems.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Main Components of a GIS (Burrough 1986) \\n \\n5. GIS Enabled STEP Process  \\nA labour market planning initiative to which th e GIS has been applied as a Decision Support \\nSystem is called STEP into Construction . STEP is being used by the industry’s Sector Skills \\nCouncil in the UK (CITB Construc tionSkills), to address skills shortages in the construction \\nlabour market by attracting females and ethni c minorities who are under-represented in the \\nconstruction labour force. It has been sugges ted that the reluctance of women and ethnic \\nminorities to enter the industry severely limi ts the labour pool from which the industry can \\nrecruit (Druker & White, 1996; Wall, 1998). W ith the STEP initiative, if an employer \\nguarantees an interview for a job vacancy, CI TB ConstructionSkills provides support for a \\ntrial period of six weeks for adult ethnic minorit y and female candidates.  Recruitment at the \\nend of the trial is based on merit alone and is  at the discretion of the employer. CITB \\nConstructionSkills supports associated costs such  as short-term childcare, diversity training \\nfor staff and site supervisors, or an equal opportunities recruitment campaign aimed at finding \\nsuitable candidates.  \\n \\n5.1 The STEP Process before GIS Input & Verification \\nStorage & \\nDatabase \\nManagement \\nOutput & \\nPresentation Transformation \\n& \\nManipulation Query \\nInput ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

With this approach, the ILM organization recruits \\nthe candidates and offers them the six week s trial for which they are paid by CITB \\nConstructionSkills regardless of outcome. At the end of the six weeks the ILM employer and \\nthe candidate fill in an ‘outcome form’ as proof that a STEP trial has taken place.

This makes it difficult to keep  track of the different ethnic backgrounds of \\nthe candidates and to verify whether the candidates met the required standard of the \\ninitiative.  \\n• There is no contact between CITB ConstructionSkills and the candidate in order to gain \\nimportant feedback on which the initiativ e can be improved. CITB has no way of \\nknowing if the candidates procure jobs at the end of the trial or not. Similarly, there is no \\nfeedback from the ILMs to CITB on the prog ress of the candidates while they are on the \\nsix weeks trial.   \\n• CITB ConstructionSkills has no control over the profile of candidates being secured for \\nthe trial process. Thus, there is more emphasis on candidates going through the trial \\nperiod rather than them securing a job at the end. \\n• The process involves many manual steps such as form filling and filing. \\n• The ILMs tend to secure candidates from the ar eas where they are based, which mean that \\nonly certain geographical areas tend to  benefit from the STEP initiative. \\n \\n5.3 Objectives of GIS Application \\nThe rationale for applying GIS to the STEP init iative was based primarily on a review of the \\ninitiative, which recommends that the focus of  STEP should be on ‘job outcomes’ (i.e. the \\ncandidate securing a proper job at the end of the trial). In order to achieve this CITB ConstructionSkills has to recruit suitable cand idates and employers to participate in the \\ninitiative, which therefore requires informa tion on the geographical distribution of both \\neligible candidates and employers. However, th e current process does not readily have access \\nto this information, so there is scope for the us e of GIS to model this and explore a variety of \\nscenarios. It is this shift that gives the im petus to look at GIS in the context of STEP. \\nThe objectives of the propos ed GIS-based process were: \\n• To automate the STEP process in order to fa cilitate better data integration, accessibility \\nand enhanced utility; \\n• To create a central resource that holds all the necessary information required for the STEP \\ninitiative, which will help in the tracking and monitoring of successful job outcomes and \\nthe recording of retention rates; \\n• To introduce better integration of operations and collaborations with  other entities (i.e. \\nother departments in CI TB ConstructionSkills); ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This process was managed in three phases: \\nFirstly, the system was demonstrated and th e users trained in its operation; secondly the \\ndepartmental managers with overall operation of  the system were interviewed along with the \\narea manager and the Equal Opportunities officer  who is responsible for overseeing the STEP \\nprogramme; and finally a workshop was held at which all of the managers were invited to \\ndiscuss the system and its operation. The cumu lative results of this evaluation process are \\npresented below.  \\n 5.4.1 Functionality of the System \\nA simple questionnaire was used to evaluate  the relative performanc e and utility of the \\nsystem. The respondents included the managers  and staff from each of the departments \\ninvolved in the STEP implementation proces s described above. With regard to its \\nfunctionality, the respondents rated the system as being effective at facilitating the STEP \\nprocess.  \\n 5.4.2 User Interface \\nThe second part of the questionn aire related to the usability of  the interface that was designed \\nto make access to the information easier. The syst em was seen as being relatively easy to use, \\nparticularly in terms of the user interface which made it easier to perform tasks which met their individual needs.  \\n 5.4.3 Interviews \\nA series of semi-structured inte rviews were carried out with the departmental managers to \\ngain further insight into their department’s perspective of the prot otype.

Discussion \\nOne of the most important outcomes of the application is the way it has enhanced the work \\npractices and integration of the different depart ments at CITB ConstructionSkills. Before the \\nGIS application was introduced, there had been no mechanisms to share STEP information. \\nThe GIS has been used to formalise the inform ation flows, as well as in assisting the \\norganization to achieve its new focus of ‘j ob outcomes’. Thus, the GIS has presented an \\nopportunity for the organization to enhance its cross-departmental work ing to ensure that \\ntheir job outcomes and targets are successfully achieved.   \\nAt a wider level, the GIS has the potential to  facilitate many other labour market planning \\nissues. Most problem solving tasks in labour  market planning require reference to both \\ntabular and mapped data, which GIS integrates e ffectively. The ability to integrate different \\ntypes of information and highlight  patterns in the data means th at it can indi cate potential \\nproblems that might occur in the future. The abil ity of GIS to integrate with almost any other \\nsoftware provides many opportunities to impr ove the richness of the industry’s labour \\nplanning information.   \\nIn terms of the current training and skills e nvironment GIS has the potential to make a huge \\ncontribution to the provision of a robust pla nning tool for training providers and funding \\nagencies. As a Sector Skills Council, CITB Cons tructionSkills is tasked by the government to \\nunderstand and articulate the training needs of employers and work with funding agencies \\nsuch as the Learning and Skills Council and tr aining provides such as colleges to provide a \\nsolution to these needs. With its potential to ab sorb and integrate large volumes of data such \\nas skills types needed, qualifications required and also the geographical location where they \\nare needed, GIS can assist in ensuring that ther e are the “right people with the right skills, in \\nthe right place at the right time”.

The GIS has the potential to assist in \\nthe regional observatory work particularly as  it has the capability to demonstrate outputs \\nvisually by geographic location. The ultimate go al of having a national observatory is for it to \\nserve as an accepted central so urce of labour market information nationally. GIS has a vital \\nrole to play in helping to achieve this goal. Construction labour market information tends to \\nbe produced with diverging fr equency from a variety of sources managed by different \\ninstitutions. This makes it easy to have severa l versions of the same data showing different \\ndegrees of updates. The use of the GIS as a ce ntral resource holding th is information should \\nhelp eliminate these problems thereby improvi ng the quality of the data and helping to avoid \\ndiscrepancies. It also makes updating the information quicker and easier. Having a central \\nresource for construction labour market info rmation will encourage partnership and data \\nsharing among agencies and communities who have responsibility for LMP.  \\n \\nThe ability of GIS to integrate with almost a ny other software, and its functionality of being \\nembedded directly into other software programs to extend their usefulness, can be an added \\nbonus to LMP. This provides several flexible wa ys in which the technology can be used to \\nimprove the richness of planning information.  A measure of the effectiveness of the \\nconstruction industry is linked to how well it manages its resources, especially the \\nproductivity of its labour force, which well-impl emented GIS applications can help optimise. \\n \\n7. Conclusions \\nIn this paper the use of GIS in construction labo ur market planning has been discussed. This \\nhas been illustrated through a specific GIS app lication that is being used to help in the \\ndiversification of the UK cons truction industry labour market. Th e ability of GIS to integrate \\ndifferent and varied datasets together to have a bigger picture of what is happening \\ngeographically creates a solid platform on whic h plans for the future of the industry labour \\nmarket can be built. The GIS can assist the indus try in refining its labour market information \\nby eliminating redundancy and creating faster and easier access to data. It also offers \\nopportunities for organisations inte rested in the construction la bour market to integrate their \\nwork activities and data resources for construction labour market planning. \\n \\nThis paper has also shown the inherent prob lems involved in the implementation of a GIS-\\nbased system for labour market planning. Although well intentioned and conceived as a \\ntechnological tool, the implementation process wa s not well prepared enough to take account \\nof the socio-technical system into which it wa s to be embedded. It can be seen that ICT \\nsystem implementation require s careful management as, wh ilst many positive conditions \\nexisted within the case study or ganisation, rapid internal and external changes can quickly \\nhave a deleterious impact on the system’s impl ementation. To be deployed effectively in the \\norganizational arena and its full potential realised, its implementation must involve a \\nconcurrent structural and cultu ral realignment to take account of the integrated working \\nwhich it promotes.  \\n \\nClearly, there is scope for the use of GIS to he lp tackle a variety of planning problems in the \\nconstruction industry. Labour market planning  is a prime application area as has been \\ndemonstrated by the example presented in this paper. \\n \\n \\n  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Th is perception of a skilled labor shortage has \\nbeen communicated among contractors and within  professional organizations and has been \\ndocumented, measured and identified in literatur e.  Studies have been completed to identify \\nissues and develop best practices  to train and educate craft workers, but to date very little \\nresearch has focused on what these individuals are seeking in a career, from an employer and \\nwithin their work.  This study is part of an  initiative to capture information regarding \\nrecruitment and retention practices employed by construction firms from both management \\nand craft worker viewpoints.  The goal of the research is to determine how well the ideals of \\nmanagement, mesh with the needs and expectations  of the craft workers relating to successful \\nrecruitment and retention practices. \\nThe first phase of the project examined the current percepti ons among construction \\nmanagers about effective recruitment and re tention practices for skilled construction \\nlaborers. This led to the creation of a pilot survey that was presented on the internet to \\ngather data concerning effective recruitment an d retention practices from the viewpoint of \\na construction manager. The information coll ected was used to develop a survey of the \\nlabor force to verify if the recruitment and retention practices perceived by management \\nto be successful actually meet their needs, desires and expectations.  The paper presents \\nthe results of the pilot study phase  of the experimental design.  \\nIntroduction  \\n This paper addresses the si gnificant reasons fo r the shortage of skilled labor as \\nidentified in the current relevant literature, do cuments how this information was used to develop \\na pilot survey of managers and skilled labor, and pr esents trends identified  during the pilot study.  \\nThe goal is to define the areas that require additi onal leadership efforts from the industry to more \\neffectively recruit and retain skilled labor. \\n The findings of the research presented will be used to generate primary surveys for both \\nmanagement and craft workers.  The information will also aid in the refinement of the research methodology. There is no expectation that th e data obtained from the pilot survey will be \\nstatistically significant. The goal is to probe responses to various  types of questions and issues \\nrequired to generate a survey that will effectivel y capture information useful to industry leaders \\nand the successful completion of the research program outlined below.  \\n1. Conduct a literature review, to identify info rmation relating to labor shortages and the \\nrecruitment and retention issues su rrounding the construction industry. \\n2.

Analyze survey responses from management  and skilled labor and identify trends \\nregarding perceived effective recr uitment and retention practices. \\n6. Produce statistically valid data  relevant to recruitment and retention practices in the \\nconstruction industry.  \\nBackground \\n  Evidence of a skilled labor shortage: According to a 2001 Construction Industry \\nInstitute survey, 75% of the responding contractors surveyed indicated that they were faced with \\nskilled labor shortages (Construction Industry Inst itute, 2001). A study published by the National \\nCenter for Construction Education and Rese arch (NCCER) in 1997, found that 92% of \\nconstruction firms that have offices in multiple st ates reported skilled la bor shortages, and 85% \\nof the survey participants thought that current skilled laborers were not as skilled as required for \\nthe present market (Shelar, 1998).  \\nEconomic Factors:  The shortage of skilled labor in the construction industry was \\npredicted in the late 1980’s (Schriener, 1990).  The recession years of the late 1970’s through the \\nmid 1980’s had a very important and lasting effect  on the industry. Many of the older skilled \\nworkers retired “early” due to the prolonged  recession (Korman & Kohn, 1995). The 1980’s \\nrecession also indirectly lead to a decline in  craft/labor union membership. In the 1970’s union \\nmembership accounted for 40% of skilled labor  in construction. In the year 2000, union \\nmembership was 18.3%. It is unclear whether or  not unions could have protected and helped \\nmaintain increases in workers pay. It is clear th at after the recession there was strong pressure on \\ncontractors to decrease costs. This led to a leve ling off in wage increases, a decrease in wage \\nincreases in some areas, and a shift in power from unions to open-shop contractors. This trend \\nwas especially prominent among smaller contract ors resulting in lower wages and scaled back \\nbenefits packages (Roths, 1998). Pressure to lo wer costs also lead many companies to de-\\nemphasize apprenticeship programs and view them  as extra costs. The results have been \\nacknowledged recently by many contractors, co mplaining that journeymen card members in \\nmany areas do not have the skills they require.  (Grant Thornton Consulting, 1999). Low pay is \\ncertainly an issue. An estimate of a worker making $17 an hour with a spouse and two children \\nwould leave the family a weekly disposable inco me of $29. That equates to a poverty level \\nincome (based on $38,000/year for a family of four) (Yancey, 2001). \\nImage of the Constr uction Industry: Another important factor indicated in the decline \\nof skilled workers is the negative percepti on associated with the construction industry. \\nConstruction was rated 247 out of 250 possible career options by high school seniors (Katz, \\n2001). Studies show that general public perception of  the construction industry and that of craft \\nworkers is that of an “uneducated, dirty, gruf f, unprofessional, and not well paid” set of \\nindividuals working in dangerous activities (Rosenthal, 1990). Cons truction competes for a spot \\nin the top three most dangerous professions ev ery year, with the other two being commercial \\nfishing tied with mining, and fi re fighting. These facts lend cred ence to at least part of the \\ncontributing factors that lead to negative public perception of the construction industry. \\n \\nRetention of Skilled Workers: The construction industry ha s historically relied on \\nimmigrants to fill skilled craft and unskilled labor positions. This co ntinues to be the case \\ntoday, except that the majority of new immi grants are arriving unskilled from Central and \\nSouth America. Several contractors have indicat ed that Hispanics have played an important \\nrole in filling many positi ons and that the retention rate is 35% higher for 1st generation and ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

It can be infe rred that attracting half of \\nthe potential work force in the U.S. to construction is a major issue and retaining the small \\npercent that has chosen constructi on as a career is a challenge.  \\n Several contractors have indicated that  one of the major obstacles to employee \\nretention is the resistance to relocate for a job (Carpenter, 2001 & 1998).  Construction, by \\nnature, requires workers to move from project to  project, as the work dictates. Projects may \\nbe next door to each other, as in the case of  track housing construction, or all over the world \\nfor specialized projects such as power plants and hydro-elec tric dams. Contractors have \\nexperienced a large amount of resistance from sk illed craft workers to travel even 20 miles to \\nthe next job, let alone 100 miles. This is particularly true if there is a lot of work in the local \\narea for which the worker is qualified (U .S. DOL, Bureau of Statistics, 2000).  \\nMethodology \\n The first step of this research program was to generate a pilot survey based upon the \\nliterature review to assess ma nagement perceptions. The pilot survey was first released to \\nmanagers as the researchers felt the informati on obtained in the management survey would \\nhelp generate questions for the craft worker survey.  \\n The survey was launched with the gene rous help of the Associated General \\nContractors of America (AGC) and the Nati onal Center for Constr uction Education and \\nResearch (NCCER). It was published as a direct  link on their websites for three weeks and \\nwas easily located by a scrolling banner on thei r main pages. The survey could be completed \\nby anyone that accessed either  website and was not limited to members of either \\norganization. The researchers realized that the survey would reach a limited audience; \\nhowever, the intent was to determine the releva nce of the questions and if the methodology \\nwas appropriate.  The goals of the pilot test ques tions were to probe attitudes in the following \\nareas: \\n(1) Importance of pay in recruitment and retention \\n(2) Importance of intrinsic qualities (i .e., Company loyalty) on retention \\n(3) Influence of travel on employee retention  \\n(4) Effect of safety, reputation, and advancement opportunities on retention \\n(5) Effect of training on recruitment and retention \\n(6) Identify areas of concern about skilled labor from a manager’s point of view \\nPilot Study Information Collected  \\n The information collected was not anony mous and was not the intention of the \\nresearchers. The researchers were also seek ing methodology feedback a nd industry opinion.  \\nThis will not be done on the primary surveys, as anonymous data is essential to limiting any \\nbias by either the researchers or the participants. \\nRespondent information collecte d included geographical area , company size, and type \\nof construction. The choices given for the type of construction were designated as \\ncommercial building construction, large and smal l heavy civil, residential construction, or \\nspecialty construction (such as electrical, mech anical, etc). The researchers were aware that \\nmost companies who would view these webs ites represent commercial and heavy civil \\ncontractors, and therefore the pilot test results may not be representative of the entire \\nconstruction industry.  \\nA majority of the information generated was classified mathematically as cardinal (or \\nnominal) data, based upon the type of questions  asked.

Maloney, M. ASCE and Andrea D. Mitnick, Ph.D. \\n Introduction \\nDespite efforts over almost three decades to  integrate women into construction, the \\noverwhelming majority of the i ndustry’s skilled trades workforce consists of men and is run \\nby men for men.  In 1978, the industry was a pproximately 2.0% female.  Today, it is \\napproximately 2.5%.  However, this situation must change because of  factors outside the \\ncontrol of the industry. \\nRobert M. Gasperow, respected director of  the Construction Labor Research Council, \\npublished an analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and U.S. Department of the Census \\ndata and the implications for the construction labor market in a paper “Craft Labor Supply \\nOutlook 2005 - 2015”  (Gasperow, 2005).  The findi ngs have significant implications for the \\nconstruction industry: \\n● Recent labor shortages have increased the awareness of the need for recruiting and \\nretaining new entrants. \\n● Because of the time required for training, there is a lag between recruiting new entrants \\nand the availability of trained craft workers. \\n● The construction industry will need to a dd 185,000 workers annually over the next ten \\nyears to replace workers retiring or otherw ise leaving the industry and to allow for \\ngrowth. \\n● Because of the physical demands of construc tion work, the working life of construction \\nworkers is shorter than those in other industrie s.  Consequently, retirement begins earlier. \\n● A large influx of Latino workers allowed th e industry to meet increasing demand in \\nrecent years. \\n● The number of Baby Boomers leaving the industr y will increase faster than the number of \\nMillennial Generation members entering th e industry, thus creating significant \\ncompetition for the new labor force entrants. \\n● The composition of the new entrants will change because of differences in growth rates:  \\nWhites, 6%; Blacks, 21%, and Latinos, 23%. \\n● There will be increasing competition between  construction and all other industries for \\nnew entrants. \\n● The median age of all constr uction craft workers was 33 years of age in 1988 and 37 in \\n1997.  By 2003, it had increased to 38 and for union members it was 39. \\n● The growth rate of males in the labor force is  expected to be 1.0% and for women 1.3%.  \\nThe projected growth rate for Latinos is 2.9%. \\n● While women are participating in greater numbers in the work force in general, they are \\nnot doing so in construction.  The increasi ng entry of Latinos represents the biggest \\nchange in construction. \\n \\n \\n  \\n●  “An actual shortage of bodies is highly unlik ely.  A shortage of labor in construction \\nmeans a shortage of adequately trained, skilled, productive persons.  In addition, \\nshortages can occur when there are an ade quate number of persons, but there is a \\nmismatch between skills available and skills required.  There is also the possibility that \\nthere is a geographic imbalance in available craft workers.” ____________________________ \\n1Raymond-Shaver Chair Professor of Construction Engineering and Management, Department of \\nCivil Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506-0281 \\n2Associate Professor of Speech Communication,  Kutztown University, Kutztown, PA 19530 ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Consequently, the female share of the labor force will be \\nincreasing \\n \\nThe History \\nAs a result of the Civil Rights movement, the 1964 Civil Rights Act was passed with \\nTitle VII prohibiting discrimination in employme nt based on race, color, religion, national \\norigin, and sex.  Sex was not initially included in the legislation.  Instead, it was added by \\nsouthern senators in an effort to  derail the passage of the legislat ion in a belief that the Senate \\nwould never agree to prohibit discriminati on based on sex. Passage  of the legislation \\nenergized the women’s movement. Women felt empowered and exercised their rights by filing charges with the Equal Employment Oppor tunity Commission (EEO C) and class action \\nsuits against employers. \\nBecause of the composition of the membership  of feminist organizations such as the \\nNational Organization of Women (NOW), whic h was middle class white women, the focus \\nwas on opening up white collar and professional jobs to women.  With the goal of breaking \\nthrough the “glass ceiling,” the invisible barrier to the upward mobility of women in \\norganizations, there was little interest in openi ng up access to blue collar jobs to women. \\nIn the late 1960s, civil rights activists began to press for the integration of the \\nhistorically white-only building and construction trades and their unions.  The model for \\nthese locally-based programs was the “Phila delphia Plan,” which established goals and \\ntimetables for the recruitment of minorities.  Bec ause of the skilled nature of the trades and \\nthe poor educational background of most of the minority applicants, federal funds were \\nprovided to establish Labor Education A dvancement Programs (LEAP) that provided \\nremedial education, training in life skills, and a pre-apprenticeship program to give applicants \\nknowledge of constructi on and work processes and fundamentals of tool usage.  These \\nprograms were successful in opening the doors of the trades to minorities.  However, because \\nof the societal belief that constructi on was men’s work, women were not included \\nIn 1978, President Jimmy Carter amended Executive Order 11246, which requires \\naffirmative action in federal procurement, to include specific goals and timetables for the \\ninclusion of women and minorities in the constr uction of federally funde d facilities.  Goals \\nfor minorities were to be determined using the percentages of the local workforce represented \\nby minorities.  Because of the extremely low numbers of women in the trades, a national goal \\nof 3.1% rising to 6.9% was established.  Pr ogress and compliance were  to be assessed by the \\nOffice of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP).  The actual rate was 2%.  \\nThe Department of Labor’s Bureau of Ap prenticeship and Training (BAT) established \\naffirmative action requirements for the apprenticeship programs that it certifies as well as for \\nthose certified by state apprenti ceship councils.  The goal was set as 50% of the female labor \\nforce participation rate within a local area.  Thus, the goal ranged from 20% to 25% depending upon the area. \\nThe Comprehensive Training and Employmen t Act was authorized, which together \\nwith the growth of tradeswomen advocacy orga nizations, resulted in the establishment of \\nfemale pre-apprenticeship programs patterned after the LEAP programs of the early 1970s. \\n \\nThe Result ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To unders tand the reasons causing the lack \\nof progress, it is necessary to examine the legal environment within which the industry \\nfunctions as well as the industry itself \\nThe primary reason is the lack of instituti onal will on the part of government and the \\nindustry itself.  With the elec tion of Ronald Reagan as pres ident in 1980, the philosophy of \\ngovernment changed.  He distrusted government believing it to be too large and intrusive.  \\nHis approach was not to repeal legislation, bu t to slash the budget to prevent agencies from \\npursuing their missions.  Discus sions with former government  officials indicated that \\nsucceeding administrations have followed this approach with the result that the EEOC, \\nOFCCP, and the Department of Justice’s Civi l Rights Division are unable to aggressively \\npursue the integration of women into the construc tion industry.  At the same time, thinking in \\nthe country has shifted from pro affirmative actio n to government remaining neutral.  Federal \\ncourts exercise strict scrutiny to ensure that  any affirmative action requirement is tailored \\nnarrowly to benefit only the individuals harmed by discrimination.  Stat es such as California \\nhave utilized ballot initiatives to greatly restrict the use of affirmative action. \\n Historically, the constr uction industry has been pr edominantly male only.  \\nConstruction jobs were consid ered male jobs.  Even when women have demonstrated an \\ninterest and capability in performing constructi on jobs such as during wartime, women were \\nforced to give up the jobs to the men returning from war.  As said ear lier, construction is an \\nindustry of men, by men and for men. There is a belief that to be a construction worker, you \\nmust be a macho man to be able to do the out side, heavy, and dangerous  work that requires \\ngreat skill with tools.  Any intrusion by women is  a threat to that image and, consequently the \\nego of construction workers. The industry ha s fought any effort to integrate women. \\n For a truly enlightening look at the life of  women attempting to integrate the trades, \\nthe reader is directed to three works in which women were allowed to present their own \\nstories in all the vivid and graphic deta il that would be lost in surveys: We’ll Call You If We \\nNeed  You by Susan Eisenberg, Hard-Hatted Women – Life on the Job , by Molly Martin, and \\nAlone in a Crowd – Women in the Trades Tell Their Stories  by Jean Ruth Schroedel.  A \\nsummary of the reasons advanced for the lack  of women in the construction trades today \\ninclude: \\n• Discrimination in hiring – Many women assert th at contractors simply will not hire them \\neither because of a belief that women are unable to do the work or because of a fear of \\nnegative reactions from the contractors employees result ing in turmoil on the site. \\n• Hiring women only in response to outside re quirements, e.g., government affirmative \\naction requirements.  Women are hired and pl aced on government jobs and laid off when \\nno longer needed to meet government requirements. \\n• Discrimination in training – For women, appr enticeship is the primary pathway into the \\ntrades.  These programs typically require 160 hours of classroom instruction and 2000 \\nhours of on-the-job (OJT) training each year of the program.  The OJT is divided into \\nhours by subject area to allow the developmen t of skills taught in the classroom.  Many \\nwomen allege that they are not provided w ith the full spectrum of training in the \\napprenticeship program.  Instead, they are as signed to work that is menial, boring, and \\nhaving little potential for skill development.  This results in a potential mismatch between \\nthe skills required to perform the available work and the skills possessed by the available \\nwomen. \\n• Lack of a job – A lack of a job, whether it be a result of a business downturn or \\ndiscrimination in hiring and/or  training is a serious matter for any worker.  Many of the \\nwomen who have tried to enter the trades are single mothers, with serious financial ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

They typically lack the financia l cushion to ride out an extended period of \\nunemployment.  They may be forced to leave the industry to support their family.  \\n• Although there are exceptions, many apprenti ceship programs have adopted a passive \\napproach to recruit women a nd have exhibited little commitment to it.  Why go after \\nfemales when you can get enough males to fill the available slots?  A lot of people want \\njobs; we’ll wait for them to knock on the door.  \\n• Sexual harassment - Sexual harassment violat es laws prohibiting sex discrimination in \\nemployment.  As amended, Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Ac t established that \\nunwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexua l favors, and other ve rbal or physical \\nconduct of a sexual nature const itutes sexual harassment when: \\n1. submission to such conduct is made either expl icitly or implicitly a term or condition \\nof an individual’s employment; \\n2. submission to, or rejection of, such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for \\nemployment decisions affect ing such individual; or \\n3. such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an \\nindividual’s work performance or creating an  intimidating, hostile, or offensive work \\nenvironment. \\nConstruction workers, in general, are perceive d to be sexist and racist.  There is a great \\ndeal of history to support this perception.  The sexual harassment of female workers is a \\nmajor impediment to attracting and retaining highly qualified women as craft workers.  \\nSome women have survived by putting up with  the harassment until they qualify as \\njourney-level workers and then moving on to jobs  such as electrical inspectors that do not \\nrequire them to work with ma le construction workers.  These are government jobs that \\nhave better protection against sexual harassment. \\nMany construction sites satisfy criterion 3 above as an intimidating, hostile, or offensive \\nwork environment.  Upon entering a site, wome n may be subjected to taunts and requests \\nfor sexual favors, find crude sexual objects left in their tools, pornographic pictures posed \\naround the job site, and physical assault in cluding groping, unwanted touching, and \\nassault.  Harassment appears to be perceived as a means of driving women off the sites.  \\nA recent survey of female j ourney-level workers and apprentices in California determined \\nthat 57% of the women had been sexually ha rassed during the past year (California \\nApprentice Council, 2004).  Is it any wond er why many women do not want to subject \\nthemselves to life on a construction site?   Many female apprentices see leaving the \\nindustry as their only option if th ey are to retain their dignity. \\nIn 2005, the skilled trades are only 2.5% fe male, essentially unchanged in twenty-seven \\nyears.  As documented at the beginning of th is paper, women must become a much more \\nsignificant source of labor fo r the construction industry.  How do we do that? \\n \\nThe Solution \\nIf the construction industry is to meet its needs of 185,000 new craft workers each year for \\nthe next ten years, it must consider women.  It is even more crucial for the union sector \\nbecause this sector must find and employ the “bes t” workers to justify the significantly higher \\nwage and benefit package received as comp ared to nonunion workers.  Therefore, the \\nremainder of the paper will focus on union orie nted approaches to recruiting and retaining \\nwomen. \\nThere is a lead time between hiri ng an individual and that indivi dual’s availability as a skilled \\nworker.  Apprenticeships last between three to  five years so unions and their training \\ndirectors must adopt a longer time pers pective on the apprenticeship programs. \\nA six phase program for the recruitment and rete ntion of women in the skilled trades in the \\nconstruction industry is proposed with  the elements presented below: ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Construction is not an industry th at is readily or realistically \\nportrayed in the popular media.  Forensic scie nce, military, and law and order shows have \\ncaptivated the public and are driving college admiss ions.  It is critical that construction be \\npresented to children as early as possible so th at they become aware of it and begin to think \\nabout opportunities within it.  The awareness pr ograms developed must include examples of \\nwomen and people of color.  Some examples of current programs are: \\n• Bob the Builder – popular children’s TV show and games \\n• Construction Jack & Jill – dolls  representing various crafts \\n• If I Had a Hammer – a program developed by Perry Wilson to teach math to late \\nelementary and early middle school stude nts.  Students spend a day building a \\nprefabricated house and receive three weeks of tutoring in math.  They learn about \\nbuilding and actually use to ols including power tools. \\n• From Crayons to CAD –  a design/build program targeted to middle schoolers that \\nprovides a basis for inter-school competiti on in which students learn what goes into \\ndesigning a building and how to build while le arning the math and science necessary to \\ndo it.  \\n \\nFamiliarization  \\nIn today’s world of video games and the Internet, kids rarely build things or work with tools \\nunless someone in their family does so.  Ther e is a real need to familiarize children, \\nespecially girls, with tools and how  to use them.  It is particular ly important that girls learn in \\na single sex environment so that they are not intimidated by boys. Some current programs \\naddressing this need are: \\n• If I Had a Hammer – for girls and boys and discussed above \\n• Rosie’s Girls – a summer camp program for girls to expose them to building and \\ncharacter and skill development, focused on middle school girls \\n• Girlpower – a program developed by BE&K, a nonunion firm, but adaptable for the union \\nsector that focuses on high school girls \\n• Girls, Inc. – formerly known as the Girls’ Cl ubs of America is focused on girls 8-20 years \\nof age.  Addresses character and skill development and occupational awareness.  Operates Project Dollhouse with its partner Home Depot in which girl s build dollhouses \\n• Girl Scouts – focuses on girls 11-14.  Th e Boy Scouts have 16 merit badges directly \\nrelated to construction.  Girl  Scout officials are amenable to considering badges in the \\nnon-traditional occupations and activities. \\n• YWCA – licenses programs from Girls Inc. \\n• Exploring – a program devel oped by Learning for Life aime d at 15-18 year old boys and \\ngirls in which a club or crew is developed around specific interests.  Ones focused on the \\nskilled trades have been developed \\n• Charter high schools for the trades - similar to vo-tech schools, but focused solely on the \\nconstruction trades \\n• Preapprenticeship – for adults, similar to the LEAP programs described above. \\n \\nRecruitment\\n \\nIt is critical to understand that recruitment is  an on-going process that begins early with the \\nawareness and familiarization activities.  The go al is to identify kids early who may have the \\naptitude and interest to pursue a career in the building trades.

While doing \\nthis, she identifies girls who have an interest  in carpentry and mentors them toward a career \\nin carpentry.  When appropriate, this girl is  recruited for the apprenticeship program.  The \\norganizations listed below are prime sources  of recruits for apprentice programs. \\n• High schools \\n• Vo-tech schools \\n• Charter high schools for the trades \\n• Community colleges \\n• Community-based organizations – there ar e many tradeswomen advocacy groups around \\nthe country such as Tradeswomen Inc. in the San Francisco Bay Area and  Wider \\nOpportunities for Women in Washington, DC th at recruit women interested in the trades \\nand conduct pre-apprenticeship programs to prepare them for application to apprentice \\nprograms. \\n Selection\\n \\nThe selection process needs to be more objective and be able to identify issues such as \\nmotivation for a career in the trades.  Women may have experience in such activities as \\nsewing, which, while not directly related to construction, provides them with an \\nunderstanding of design, measurement, and fabrication that are relevant. \\n \\nTraining  \\n• Transition to Trainer - A significant aspect  of apprenticeship is the training that an \\napprentice receives on-the-job from journey-leve l workers.  This is a haphazard process at \\nbest.  The Wisconsin Technical College Syst em Board and the Bureau of Apprenticeship \\nStandards of the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development produced a program \\ntitled “Transition to Trainer” that trains appr entices in how to be effective trainers once \\nthey move up to journey-level status. \\n• Sexual Harassment prevention – every person working in the construction industry should \\nbe required to participate in such a program .  The hostile work environment present on \\nmany sites must be changed and made more receptive to women. \\n• Cultural Diversity & Awareness – a comment that  construction is changing from the “Old \\nWorld to the Third World” illustrates the pre ssing need for cultural and diversity training \\nfor all construction workers.   The trades us ed to be comprised of  large groups of ethnic \\nworkers who gravitated toward one another.  Fo r example, bricklayers in some areas were \\nof Irish descent while tile and terrazzo workers were Italian.  With ethnic conclaves \\ndispersing and more people going to college, th e days of the ethnic tr ade were numbered.  \\nNow trades are becoming more and more culturall y diverse.  People need to be sensitized \\nto cultural differences. \\n• Record keeping – to prevent apprentices from being under trained, a system of \\nmeasurement must be employed to track the OJT received by an apprentice and monitor \\nactions taken to ensure that the apprentice is receiving the full ra nge of training required \\nto produce a journey-level worker. \\n Retention\\n \\nOnce a woman has begun the apprenticeship pr ogram and even moved up to journey-level, \\nsteps must be taken to create an environment in which she can continue to succeed.

It does not \\nnecessarily have to be a woman, but that would be desirable. \\n• Minority & Women’s Caucus – these have been successfully organized in the IBEW and \\nprovide a mechanism for women and minorities to  gather outside of the union to discuss \\nand deal with issues. \\n• Support systems – although no longer entirely  a female issue due to the growing number \\nof men solely responsible for raising their chil dren, child care is an  issue of particular \\nconcern to women.  So, too, is the issue of transportation in urban areas.  A support \\nsystem needs to be developed to provide assi stance.  It should be area-wide and involve \\nmultiple trades. \\n• Union constitution – because most sexual harassment is between members of a union on a \\nsite, precise definitions of what constitutes sexual harassment must be made clear in the \\nconstitution.  Furthermore, e xplicit provisions must  be made in the union’s constitution \\nfor members bringing sexual harassment compla ints and the penalties associated with \\nsuch conduct. \\n• Collective bargaining agreement – provisions mu st be included in collective bargaining \\nagreements because most sexual discrimination is  caused by a contractor’s refusal to hire \\nwomen or other practices and the action of foremen, who are operating as an agent of management. \\n• Ombudspersons – an informal mechanism shoul d be created to set tle issues without \\nformal proceedings. \\n \\nConclusion \\nThere are numerous other issues such as wor kplace culture, sanitary facilities, personal \\nprotective equipment and clothing, ergonomics, and reproductive hazards that need to be \\naddressed.  However, the primary action that needs to be taken to increase the number of \\nwomen in the trades is for contractors a nd unions to take a strong stand that sexual \\nharassment will not be tolerated, and to put in to place numerous mechanisms to enforce this \\nstand.   This should begin to change the workpl ace culture.  We believe that as the workplace \\nculture changes, more women will become the valu ed and significant source of labor that the \\nconstruction industry so desperately needs.  An  additional outcome will be the development \\nof a workplace where everyone, men and women, can thrive in a civil, fair and safe \\nenvironment. \\n \\nAcknowledgement \\nThe authors are grateful to the Sheet Metal Workers International Association/Sheet Metal \\nAir Conditioning Contractors National Associat ion National Labor Management Cooperation \\nCommittee for its support of this research.  \\nReferences \\nEisenberg, S.

In the United States, twenty states have enabling \\nlegislation that permits some form of public-private initiatives for transportation projects.  \\nInternationally, the Private Finance Initiativ e in the United Kingdom is well known while the \\nuse of private capital for infrastructure proj ects within emerging economies has become a \\nglobal trend.  Indeed, public-private partne rships (PPP’s) have become an important \\ninfrastructure development strate gy.  This approach, however, presents unique challenges for \\nthe public and private sector agents charge d with forging their scope, structure and \\nconditions.  Quite often, thos e interested in pursuing PPP’s are treading new ground with \\nlittle direction or guidance.  A ccordingly, the intent of this paper is to identify and briefly \\ndescribe the competencies necessary to estab lish effective, long-term relationships between \\nthe public and private sector.  The presenta tion is based upon the lessons learned from \\nnumerous case studies of infrastructure devel opment where substantial private resources were \\ninvolved.  These lessons from th e past provide an organization al “primer” fo r those seeking \\nto partner with either a private enterprise to  create or improve infrastructure services. \\nIntroduction \\nThe participation of the private sector in the pr ovision of public services is clearly one of the \\nmost significant, recent trends in governme nt.  In fact, a survey of a dozen national \\ngovernments across the globe in the late 1990’s i ndicated that a significant majority of the \\nrespondents expected “that the most successful  government structure in 2010 will be one in \\nwhich government focuses on po licy and project/supplier manage ment, allowing the private \\nsector to deliver most traditional public serv ices.” (Economist Intelligence Unit, 1999).  \\nCertainly, the transition toward this type of model is gaining momentum within the \\ninfrastructure development and management domain.  Consider national initiatives such as \\nThe United Kingdom’s Private Finance Initiative  or Australia’s Partnerships Victoria  as well \\nas regional or local programs such as the enabli ng legislation in place in twenty U.S. states \\nthat permits some form of public-private initiat ives on state transportation projects (Reinhardt \\n2004).  Indeed, the prediction made by the su rvey’s respondents is on its way towards \\nrealization. \\nOne of the interesting aspects of this shift in infrastructure provision is the approach adopted \\nto establish and govern the re lationship between the public and private sectors in this new \\nenvironment.  In The United Kingdom and Aust ralia, for example, the central or national \\ngovernment has shaped the policy and fashioned th e conditions that define the “partnerships” \\nformed between the public and private sectors.  Alternatively, in Canada and the United \\nStates, many public-private part nerships have been struck by  state, provincial or local \\ngovernments without a well-defined  national policy or framework.  Moreover, at least in the \\nUnited States, it appears unlikely that a stri ct federal policy will ever emerge to govern \\npublic-private partnership arrangements for infr astructure.  Thus, state and local governments \\nas well as many federal agencies are likely to continue to shape their own partnership \\narrangements with the private sector.

Establishing a stable a nd reliable national marketplace is rather challenging since each \\nof the local agencies can adopt fairly unique pa rtnership “conditions”.  This environment is \\nparticularly troublesome for private market player s because they are generally forced to adapt \\nto differing provisions depending upon where they  are operating within a particular nation’s \\nboundaries.  Hence, the material presented hereaf ter is intended for t hose agencies that are \\ninstituting public-private partne rships without a national policy  and regulatory framework.  \\nThese agencies must develop the competenci es necessary to create partnerships that preserve \\nthe public’s interests  but can also attract private participation .

Failu re to do so, however, will either \\nprevent or slow the maturation of this market. \\nOverview of Public-Private Partnerships \\nAny discussion about the competencies ne cessary for establishing a public-private \\npartnership (PPP) should start by characterizing PPP’s.  Wh y is characterization important?  \\nCharacterization will establish the nature of th e relationship between the public and private \\nsectors, which will in turn drive the discussi on about the competencies required.  In other \\nwords, are PPP’s truly partnerships or somethi ng else?  Indeed, partners are not merely bound \\nby mutual interests; rather, each partner has the perspective that their organizational identity \\nand competitive advantage are enhanced through participation in the partnership (Kingsley \\nand O’Neil 2004).  A start is to establish a defi nition for this arrangement.    Unfortunately, \\nan agreed upon definition is somewhat elusive.   For example, Table 1 illustrates four \\ndefinitions.  Although similar, these definitio ns do not fully answer the question about \\nwhether these arrangements are partnerships or  something else.  Thus, the characterization \\neffort must look further.  \\n \\n \\nOrganization Definition \\nNational Council for Public-\\nPrivate Partnerships (USA) Public-private partnerships are a contractual arrangement whereby \\nthe resources, risks and rewards of both the public agency and \\nprivate company are combined to provide greater efficiency, better access to capital, and improved compliance with a range of \\ngovernment regulations regarding the environment and workplace. \\nCanadian Council for Public-\\nPrivate Partnerships A cooperative venture between the public and private sectors, built \\non the expertise of each partner that best meets clearly defined public needs through the appropriate allocation of resources, risks \\nand rewards. \\nInternational Monetary Fund Public-private partnerships involve private sector supply of \\ninfrastructure assets and services that have traditionally been provided by the government. \\nNational Government of the \\nUnited Kingdom Public-Private Partnerships fall into three categories: \\n• the introduction of private sector ownership into state-owned \\nbusinesses, using the full range of possible structures (whether \\nby flotation or the introduction of a strategic partner), with sales of either a majority or a minority stake; \\n• arrangements where the public sector contracts to purchase \\nquality services on a long-term basis so as to take advantage of private sector management skills incentivised by having private \\nfinance at risk. This includes concessions and franchises, where \\na private sector partner takes on the responsibility for providing a public service, including maintaining, enhancing or \\nconstructing the necessary infrastructure; and \\n• selling Government services into wider markets and other \\npartnership arrangements where private sector expertise and \\nfinance are used to exploit the commercial potential of \\nGovernment assets.

In fact, one of the \\npreconditions for success identified by the Intern ational Monetary Fund is whether or not the \\nquality of services is “contractible”.  Moreove r, one of the key policy documents issued by \\nAustralia’s Partnerships Victoria  is its “Contract Management Policy”, which claims that \\n“inadequate contract management can compromise  value for money and lead to a failure to \\nrealise the key benefits expected from the projec t” (Dept. of Treasury & Finance 2003).  This \\nevidence suggests that PPP’s are primarily long -term contractual arra ngements between the \\npublic and private sector where mutual bene fits are derived and generally little more .  \\nFurther support for this conclu sion is provided by over twenty-fi ve case studies of innovative \\ninfrastructure development strate gies that the writers have b een involved with over the last \\ndecade.  These cases were exclusively cont ractual arrangements between the public and \\nprivate sectors where private resources were  used to design, build and operate an \\ninfrastructure asset; in some instances, private finance was at risk, in others it was not.  This \\ndistinction is important since contractual or re gulatory relationships diff er substantially from \\npartnerships.  The former is focused upon ri sk assessment, allocation and management \\nwhereas the latter is focused upon synergy development and sustenance.   \\nIf this conclusion is correct, then governments within the Un ited States should be well-\\npositioned to implement PPP’s since contract ing has been used since the founding of the \\nnation (Nagle 1992).  Actually, the world has a long history of pacts similar to modern day \\nPPP’s.  In the United States for example, g overnments at all levels  routinely established \\nagreements with the private sector for the provision of infrastructure prior to World War II \\n(Miller 2000).  The development of the Illinois Central Railroad which opened for service in \\n1856 and the development of the New York City S ubway which carried its first passengers in \\n1904 are notable examples.      \\nThe current “novelty” of PPP’s is tied to the dramatic transition away from this model that \\noccurred primarily after World War II, particularly  in the United States and to a lesser extent \\nworldwide.  Legislation which began as early  as 1893 when Congress pe rmitted the Secretary \\nof Treasury to separately procure the services  of an architect during capital projects and \\nculminated in 1972 with the Brooks Act wh ich required architects and engineers to be \\nselected based upon qualifications for federa lly funded projects moved the method for \\ndeveloping and managing public infrastructure  toward what is mistakenly called the \\n“traditional” approach or design-bid-build (Mi ller 2000).  Here, the resp onsibility of finance \\nand O&M is placed with public owners and th e responsibility for desi gn and construction is \\nplaced with separate and independent private consultants and contractors. \\nEssentially, governments were once in the business of “managing the provision” of \\ninfrastructure services, and transitioned into the business of “providing” infrastructure \\nservices.  Now, governments are moving back into a managing the provision mode, primarily \\nto capitalize upon private sector expertise and efficiency through the introduction of market \\nforces.  Why is this type of contracting so different?  Fundamentally, PPP’s have a broader \\nscope and longer time-frame, and they typically require governments to: (a) determine where \\nPPP’s can provide real value, (b) establish re asonable conditions for PPP transactions or \\nagreements, (c) select private vendors or c ontractors based typical ly upon proposals as \\n                                                 \\n8 See Australia’s Partnerships Victoria  (2000), the UK’s PFI: Meeting the Investment Challenge  (2003), \\nInternational Monetary Fund’s Public-Private Partnerships  (2004), and New Zealand’s Achieving Public Sector \\nOutcomes with Private Sector Partners  (2006).

These requireme nts force governments \\nto expand the scope of their expertise in certa in arenas and to modify it in others.  For \\nexample, selecting private vendors or contra ctors based upon proposal s as opposed to bids \\ndemands competencies that the current model does not require.  Selection by bid is frequently \\nbased upon an established criter ion – lowest, responsive, res ponsible bid.  Selection by \\nproposal requires a government to adequately define the selection methodology and criteria. \\nNecessary Competencies \\nBackground.   Like PPP’s, a universal definition of organizational competencies is difficult \\nto find.  Prahalad and Hamel’s (1990) seminal paper on the core competence of the \\ncorporation brought widespread attention to the topic of organizational competencies.  More \\nrecently, Chinowsky (2000) focused attention upon this topic within the AEC community.  \\nGenerally, organizational competencies are th e knowledge, skills, and actions that an \\norganization must possess or exhi bit to effectively fulfill its mission and to provide value.  \\nMoreover, these competencies are derived from  the synergy among the organization’s human \\nresources, culture and infrastructure.  Ot her definitions are certainly plausible. \\nThe competencies proposed presume that the relationship between the public and private \\nsector is a contractual one, so the condition s are established by agr eement not regulation and \\nno deeper relationship between the two parties is sought.  Whether movement toward true \\npartnership arrangements is  beneficial or not is left for anot her discussion.  The basis of these \\ncompetencies are the lessons learned from the case studies developed by the writers, which \\nwere previously described, and the PPP gui dance documents issued by various governments \\nand institutions, in particular the policy doc uments of the UK and Australia.  Figure 1 \\nillustrates the competencies necessary to institute PPP’s for infrastructure development and/or \\nmanagement. \\n \\nFigure 1 - Competencies to In stitute PPP's for Infrastructure \\nA hypothetical local, public wa ter supply agency supplying 50  million gallons per day of \\ndrinking water to its consumers shall provide co ntext for the discussion of the competencies \\nthat follows.

The organization’s divisi ons and people should fully \\ncomprehend the organization’s di rection and purpose.  This faci litates distingui shing services \\nand activities into those that are critical , i.e. ones that add value, and those that are non-\\ncritical , ones that are necessary commodities.  S uppose the water supply agency has as its \\nbasic mission “to provide the public with water at the right quality, quantity and price”, thus \\nit would likely consider “wat er treatment operations” criti cal and “plant grounds-keeping” \\nnon-critical.  This differentiation drives the char acter of the remaining appraisal activities.  \\nClearly, introducing a private partner into a cr itical service or activity is riskier than \\nintroducing one into a non-critical service or activity. \\nUnderstand Real Assets.   Real assets, i.e. constructed facilities and equipment, \\nfacilitate the provision of infrastructure services .  An accurate inventory of these assets that \\nincludes such details as size/capacity, age, condit ion, value and operating costs is essential to \\nthe appraisal process.  While this seems obvious, establishing and maintaining this \\nunderstanding over time for a large portfolio of real assets is ra ther difficult.  For the water \\nsupply agency, this need is exacerbated by the fa ct that the majority of its physical plant is \\nunderground.  Without this information, severa l subsequent appraisal activities such as \\n“determine value” can become quite challenging. \\nMeasure Performance.   Performance measurement is one of the most critical \\ncompetencies since it facilitates risk assessment  and value determination.  Consider the water \\nsupply agency’s “plant grounds-keeping”.  Si nce this is a commodi ty-like activity, the \\nprincipal driver for introducing a private partner would likely be cost.  Thus, the current cost \\nof grounds-keeping is a key performance metric, and it should serve as a central benchmark \\nwhen electing to initiate a PPP arrangement  for grounds-keeping and monitoring a private \\npartner’s long-term performance.  “Water trea tment operations” would clearly be a different \\nstory. \\nUnderstand Market & Assess Risks/Determine Value.   Fundamentally, these \\ncompetencies demand: (a) evaluating whether qu alified private partners are available, (b) \\nidentifying and appraising the risks of introduc ing a private partner, and (c) subsequently \\ndetermining what value a private partner will add.  Lifecycle cost estimation and economic \\nevaluation are common, necessary skills.  Consid er the water supply agency again.  The risks \\nof instituting a PPP for “grounds-keeping” is gene rally low, so the real questions become is \\nthere a market for these services and is the pr ice of these services lower than our current \\ncosts?  Alternatively, the risks of institu ting a PPP for “water treatment operations” are \\ngenerally high – failure could impact water quality and quantity an d subsequently public \\nhealth and commercial/industrial productivity.  No w, the decision to move forward will likely \\nbalance such risks against the value that a priv ate partner might add such  as cost reduction, \\nwater quality improvement a nd capital investment.    \\nService Solicitation Competencies.   Once the decision to move  ahead is made, the focus \\nshifts to fashioning the PPP arrangement  and requesting private participation. \\nManage Public Affairs/Consensus.   Often, the decision to institute a PPP will draw \\nmixed reactions from the citizens that the pub lic agency serves.  Typically, the level of \\nreaction is linked to the criticality of the se rvice.  Citizens are more likely to oppose \\nintroducing a private partner into a critical se rvice, and oftentimes this opposition is funded \\nand organized.  For instance in Stockton, CA , a coalition of citizens backed by the Sierra \\nClub and Public Citizen won a lawsuit in 2003 that  blocked the city’s attempt to institute a \\nPPP for the upgrade and operation of its water supply system over 20 years (Miller 2003).

PPP’s frequently involve displacing or transitioning the \\nexisting workforce.  In fact, this reality is commonly viewed as one of the largest \\nimpediments to PPP’s in the United States (see  US Conference of Mayors 1998).  Even when \\nprivate vendors are willing to accept former public employees, working through transitioning \\nthe workforce and benefits is not a simple task .  How well this respons ibility is handled will \\nalso clearly influence the amount of opposition  that results.  More than likely, the water \\nsupply agency would need to require the priv ate partner to accept former public employees \\ninto their organization.  This would require  the partner to develop a comprehensive and \\namenable plan for public employee transition, which would include structuring compensation \\npackages to closely match current public benefits. \\nProcure/Acquire Services & Develop Concession Agreements.   The public \\nprocurement/acquisition process determines th e response of the private sector and, more \\nbroadly, the development of the market.  Public  owners must treat private participants in a \\nstable and predictable fashion.   Otherwise, potential par ticipants will pursue market \\nalternatives that are more attrac tive elsewhere.  The perception of  potential participants is of \\ngreater importance than commonly recognized sin ce the quality of the services and goods that \\nthe government acquires cannot be better than th e pool of private sect or firms willing to \\nparticipate in the acquisition process (Miller et  al. 2000).  Since PPP’s generally range from 5 \\nto 50 years, the structuring of the relations hip is extremely important.  Currently, PPP \\nagreements do not benefit from years of evolu tion like standard constr uction agreements, i.e. \\nAIA contract documents.  The ca se study research suggests that transparency in selection \\nmethodology and criteria is the most important attributes of successful procurement processes \\nand that agreement development is often effec tive as an iterative process where a publicly \\nissued initial agreement is subsequently modi fied following one or more rounds of private \\nsector review and feedback. \\nIf the water supply agency were to solicit water treatment operations services for its \\ntwo plants, then the procurement process might start by identifying the major selection \\ncriteria as qualifications & expe rience, proposed management plan, and fee for services.  The \\nwater supply agency could then evaluate the expe rience of interested re spondents to qualify a \\nshortlist and issue a detailed request for proposal s along with a draft service agreement.  The \\nqualified respondents would return the servic e agreement with comments, and the agency \\nwould issue a revised agreement.  When pr oposals are submitted, the respondents are \\nindicating satisfaction with the service ag reement conditions, and the agency would \\nsubsequently select the winning team on the basis of satisfying  published minimum \\nmanagement expectations and providing the lowest  annual service fee, where satisfaction is \\ndetermined before the fee is known. \\nDispose of Assets.   A characteristic outcome of the appraisal of infrastructure services \\nis the identification of assets that are no longer integral to the organization’s mission.  \\nEssentially, the organization needs the ability to  effectively value, market and sell or lease \\nsuch facilities.  Failure will result pr imarily in lost economic opportunities. \\nService Management Competencies.   Finally, the organization must possess the aptitude to \\nmanage PPP arrangements once they are in place. \\nManage Development & Monitor/Evaluate Services.   Frequently, PPP’s include the \\ndevelopment of new or the modification of ex isting real assets.  Thus, managing capital \\ndevelopment or reinvestment remains an import ant public agency competency.  The nature of \\nthis competency when instituting PPP’s, how ever, shifts somewhat.

Public agencies still have an interest in design & construction quality, but the principal \\nassessment of this quality occu rs once the asset is “in place” as opposed to when the asset is \\n“going into place”. \\nThis shift really redefines the quality assu rance/control program.   Reviews of design \\nplans and construction sites become less impo rtant, and more expertise associated with \\nfacility operations is necessary.  The perfor mance criteria and the review process for the \\noperating period will be set forth in the concessi on agreement.  Since each agreement will be \\nfairly unique, standard perfor mance criteria are not likely, so the public agency must \\ncarefully define reliable but reas onable performance appraisal methods.  In the case of water \\nsupply, these criteria are more easily defined thanks to well-established minimum standards \\nfor safe drinking water. \\nManage Asset Hand-over.   At the conclusion of a PPP arrangement, the real asset \\nthat the private partner operated and managed will be handed back over to the public agency.  \\nTypically, the public agency will  renegotiate a new deal with th e existing partner, find a new \\npartner or resume operations.  Regardless, th e status of the real asset becomes quite \\nimportant.  This hand-over is usually governed  by a set of return provisions.  Properly \\nstructured, these provisions can provide an a dditional safeguard against under-investment in \\nmaintenance by a contractor without introduci ng unwarranted requirements.  Most existing \\nconcession agreements stipulate an inspection  procedure followed by a corrective period, \\nmuch like the punch-list process during facility  turnover following construction.       \\nConclusion \\nThe transition to a world where the propensity of  infrastructure services is provided by the \\nprivate sector is underway.  Es sentially, governments will beco me the overseers of service \\nrather than the service providers.  Some argue th at this trend is peril ous – it erodes important, \\nexisting public sector competencies and it places  critical systems in private hands.  Peril can \\nresult  if PPP’s are entered into haphazardly or for political purposes; however, a public \\norganization that possesses the competencies de scribed can include th e erosion of existing \\ncompetencies and the private management of cr itical systems as risks during the appraisal \\nprocess.  Moreover, the public agency certainly does not abdicate its responsibility to design \\nand enforce standards.  In fact, the presence of well-defined performance criteria and \\nappropriate concession conditions provides the public sector wi th powerful recourse options \\nduring PPP’s.  Hence, a perilous outcome is not fixed; moreover, the PPP model can \\nencourage both sectors to play to their strengths, the public as policymaker and standard-\\nbearer and the private as innovator and efficiency-expert.      \\nReferences \\nChinowsky, P.

Mulva, Ph.D.1 \\n \\n1Assistant Professor, Department of Engineer ing and Technology, Texa s State University – \\nSan Marcos, 601 University Driv e, San Marcos, Texas 78666;  \\nPH (512) 245-2137; emai l: sm53@txstate.edu \\n \\nAbstract \\n \\nHallmarks of successful projects include th e delivery of technical objectives within \\nestablished time, cost and quality targets.  Ye t, situations exist where benefits beyond these \\ntargets may be realized by the use of program ma nagement techniques, such as project delay.  \\nTo substantiate this theory, this paper presen ts the results of a recent international offshore \\nfacilities program, forecast to compress overall schedule by 20% and increase return on \\ncapital employed (ROCE) by 57% through the implementation of a program management \\norganization (PMO).  As sisted by modeling and simulation so ftware originally developed at \\nthe Center for Integrated Facility Engineering (CIFE) at Stanford University, PMO leaders were projected to be able to make decisions  that would result in several quantifiable and \\npositive project outcomes.  Moreover, because such outcomes were to be obtained in the \\nabsence of changes in the internal execution of  constituent projects, evidence exists that \\n‘hidden’ benefits can be unc overed through applied program management.  As a result, the \\nfindings advocate additional research regarding th e search for optimal sets of project benefits \\nin the program environment; res earch that is currently underway. \\n \\nContemporary Program Management \\n \\nProgram management is typically  defined as “The coordinated management of a portfolio of \\nprojects to achieve a set of  business objectives (CCTA 1993). ”  While this definition does \\nrelay the importance of tying project executi on effectiveness to or ganizational goals and \\nstrategy, it does not explain the different vari ations and expressions of program management \\nthat result from different portfolios of projects .  However, it is generally accepted that four \\ntypes of program management ex ist, each differing in their approach toward the portfolio \\n(Reiss 1996): \\n \\n1. The Multi-Project Organization —management of a portfolio of projects that \\nbenefit from a consolidated approach wi thin an organization that undertakes \\nproject work exclusively.  Fluor Corporation is a good example. \\n2. The Mega Project —management of a portfolio of projects towards one specific \\nobjective.  The International Space Station is a good example of numerous \\ndifferent projects culminating in successful objectives. \\n3. Numerous Projects for One Client —management of a series of projects within an \\norganization for the same client.  Projects may differ, yet share similar technical \\nstandards.  The roll-out of discou nt retail stores is a good example.

The Program Management Organization —management of a portfolio of projects \\nall of which aim towards corp orate objectives.  Several institutional investors use \\nthis approach. \\n \\nWhile programs differ in their treatment of project portfolios,  all four program types share \\nseveral common factors.  Indeed, all program s involve many simultaneous projects, all \\nconcentrate on resources, and all need a multi-project view of scheduling.  In the architecture, \\nengineering, and construction (A/E/C) industry , not only can programs of each type be found, \\nbut many organizations implement hybrid arra ngements of these program types.  For \\nexample, large industrial-sector engineer ing, procurement, and construction (EPC) \\ncontractors organize client-speci fic alliances within a Multi-Project Organization.  Still, most \\ncompanies in the A/E/C industry are failing to realize latent value inherent in their operations.  \\nLargely, this is because incremental value is subsumed within transactional costs and \\nobscured by inappropriate work processes.  However, recent adva nces in modeling and \\nsimulation technology are challenging th e culture of benefits subtraction. \\n \\nProgram Management and Simulation \\nIn the early 1970’s, Galbraith (1974) observed how program managers could become \\nburdened by large numbers of ‘exceptions’ (i.e., non-routine situations in which project \\nworkers lacked the information to proceed, thus  requiring assistance from their managers).  \\nSince then, Galbraith’s view of organizations has advanced theo ries of organizational design, \\nbecoming a prime motivator for the developm ent of modeling and simulation technology for \\nprojects and programs.  Based on his findings, subsequent rese arch conducted at the Center \\nfor Integrated Facility Engineer ing (CIFE) at Stanford Univer sity confirmed the need to \\nmodel program organizations working on interact ing projects so that aggregate performance \\npredictions could be generated (Levitt & Kunz 2 002).  This research was commercialized by \\nthe Vité Corporation and ePM, LL C as software known as SimVision®.  This software is \\ncapable of taking a unique look at both project and program execu tion concurrently.  It allows \\na user the opportunity to model the allocation of resources to project and program activities \\nand then simulates the probability of outcome s such as schedule performance and work \\nbacklog for all projects in the program.  Ex ample inputs (i.e., a m odel) and outputs (i.e., \\npredictions) from SimVision® are illustrated in Figure 1.  Detailed explanation of the \\nprocessing methods used by SimVision® software are found in numerous articles such as \\nKunz et al. (2000) and Jin and Levitt (1996).  Recently, these methods have been used to \\nconduct virtual computational experiments in  alliance settings (Thomsen et al. 2005). \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

SimVision® Modeling and Simulation (After ePM 2003). \\n \\nApplied Project Modeling and Simulation \\n \\nIn late 2003, as a consultant employed by ePM, LLC, the author was engaged by a U.S.-\\nbased energy company to perform a comprehe nsive schedule forecast and analysis for the \\nengineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) of a large s cale petroleum project off the \\nshore of China.  This $3 Billion project was comprised primarily of se veral subprojects such \\nas a floating production storag e and offloading (FPSO) facili ty, numerous jacketed wellhead \\nplatforms (WP), a central processing complex (C PC), sub-sea pipelines,  tanker moorings, and \\nvarious transport activities.  Of these subproje cts, the FPSO facility was particularly complex \\ngiven that its hull and to psides were to be designed and fabricated by separate companies on \\ndifferent continents.  In addition, the U.S. -based energy company was partnered with an \\ninternational petroleum firm and had re cently hired a global EPC contractor. \\n \\nePM’s SimVision® software was used to create the m odel shown in Figure 2.  The model ties \\nindividual managers to subprojects  via lines of responsibility (i.e ., shown in grey).  Notably, \\nall the organizations involved in the venture are shown (i.e., from left; owner, partner, \\ncontractor, and subcontractor organizations).  Precedence  relationships between the \\nsubprojects are shown as dark, solid lines.  Pa ths for rework and coordination are displayed \\nas dark, dashed lines in cases where exceptions  might occur.  The resulting simulation output \\nis shown as a Gantt chart in Figure 3.  The simulation forecasts which subprojects are likely \\nto be critical based on their re source utilization, precedence , and likelihood for exception \\noccurrence.  In Figure 3, critical subprojects ar e shown in dark grey and represent 55% of all \\nsubprojects planned for execution.  Here, th e simulation output also identifies the revised \\ncompletion date in comparison with the expected  date generated using critical path method \\n(CPM) software.  In this case, a final project  completion date 11 months past the planned \\ncompletion date was anticipated using a 95% confidence interval.

Revised Ex ample Project SimVision® Simulation. \\n \\nApplied Program Modeling and Simulation \\n \\nIn a project management context, analysis of this program would likely be considered \\ncomplete.  However, as program management is  concerned with the attainment of benefits, \\nadditional analyses were undertaken.  For an o ffshore development project such as the one \\nconsidered here, the revenues generated from hydrocarbon production are of primary \\nconcern.  Consequently, yet a nother model was created to re present HUC and sanction of \\neach wellhead platform, the CPC, and the FPSO.  As can be seen in Figure 6, each of these subprojects was constrained within the same model (i.e., Figure 4) relative to their ‘parent’ \\nprojects and the program as a whole.  This type  of constraint was espe cially important since \\nthe particular subprojects in question were to be executed using common resources from the \\nPMO.  For example, the decomposition of the FPSO’s HUC is shown on the right side of \\nFigure 6 as a series of activities ne cessary for the production of hydrocarbons. \\n \\nWhat makes the model in Figure 6 unique is the c oncept of program delay.  In fact, one of the \\nwellhead platform HUC subprojects is shown as delayed by two months and the tie-in from a \\npreviously-existing project is shown as delayed by  six months relative to the original project \\nCPM schedule.  The specific ti me that each subproject wa s delayed was developed through \\niteration of simulation output by th e author.  Thus, in a rather counter-intuitive way, the delay \\nof certain projects within a portfolio ac tually improves the schedule and financial \\nperformance for the entire program.

This disc onnect points toward a need to  develop program management \\ninformation systems (PgMIS) to quantify the latent value realized through program \\nexecution.  One way to accomplish this is through the use of a value tree.  Indeed, each \\nbranch in the tree reflects potential outcomes of decisions as the individual projects in the \\nprogram progress toward an overall benefit.  Consequently, one path through the value tree \\ngives the greatest benefit.  The trick to obtaining this benefit is to modify the probability of a \\ndesirable outcome for each project in the pr ogram.  Today, the best means of improving \\noutcome probability are found in forecasts crea ted via modeling and simulation technology.  \\nIn fact, for the case study presented herein, the amount of latent value captured is calculated \\nto be $1.11 Billion. \\n \\nThis paper demonstrates that ‘hidden’ benef its can be uncovered through the use of program \\nmanagement.  In particular, the implementa tion of a program management organization \\n(PMO) and use of lead ing-edge modeling and simulation so ftware led to the creation of \\ncompelling performance improvement.  Howe ver, some performance improvement was \\ngained through the technique of project dela y – a technique that likely seems counter-\\nintuitive to many involved in project manageme nt.  Therefore, it stands to reason that \\ndramatic and quantifiable performance gains ar e likely only realized through a reliance on \\nprogram management practice and, partly, through a leap of faith.  For these reasons, it is \\nimperative that effective leadership remain a pr erequisite for successful program execution. \\n \\nReferences \\n \\nCCTA (UK Government Centre for Information Systems), (1993).

In order to investigate the potential for an \\nunderlying theory of agile project manageme nt, it is first necessary to understand its \\nunderlying rationale, and to then assess the possi bility of engaging any strengths in other \\ndomains. \\nThis paper describes initial research into  agile project management and identifies \\npromising areas for further research. \\nAGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT \\nAgile project management has its foundations in the management science of Deming but \\nperhaps harks back to pre-industrial revolution times, before decomposition and \\nmanagement-as-planning took a hold.  The real progress today lies in the domain of \\ninformation systems; however, it may be possible to migrate the core attributes to other \\ndomains, including construction. \\nThe evolution of agile project management can be traced from Deming through the \\nToyota development method (Liker, 2004) to the Agile movement and is well documented \\nelsewhere (Owen and Koskela, 2006).

The \\n‘Manifesto’ stressed the comparative importa nce of human contribution, product (versus \\ndocumentation), customer collabor ation and responsiveness to chan ge.  The Manifesto, together \\nwith its underlying ‘Princ iples’ (Beck and et  al, 2001b) depict a substantial con centration on the \\nearly and regular deli very of value, and the use of changes as opportunities to enha nce that value.  \\nWorking practices focus on frequen t, sustainable iterative deliveries by facilitated multi-\\nfunctional, self-organising inte rcommunicative teams.  Scrum a nd other agile methodologies add \\nto those overall foci by  prescribing numbers for the optimum team size (typically 2 to 20) and \\niteration periods (typically around 30  days, although varying widely). \\nThe Agile Project Leadership Network (APLN) followed on and has a wi der focus than just \\nsoftware, focussing on: valu e, customer, teams, individuals, context and uncerta inty.  The APLN \\nDeclaration of Interdep endence (Anderson and et al, 2005) for agile and adaptive management \\nstresses: \\n• continuous flow of value \\n• engaging customers in fr equent interactions and shared ownership.  \\n• uncertainty (should be expected) and manage (d) through iterations, anticipation, and \\nadaptation.  \\n• individuals are the ultimate source of value  \\n• group accountability for result s & shared responsibility for team effectiveness.  \\n• situationally specific strategi es, processes and practices.’ \\nAgility itself is defined by one of its originators (Dove), as follows: \\n‘The Ability of an Organization to Adapt Pr oficiently (Thrive) in a Continuously \\nChanging, Unpredictable Business Environment.   (Dove, 1996) \\nAgile systems are ones that can res pond to both reactive needs and proactive \\nopportunities - when these are unpredict able, uncertain, and likely to change.’   (Dove, 2005) \\nDove considers that agility c onsists of practices and proces ses for knowledge management, \\nvalue propositioning and response ability and sees these practices and processes as positioning \\nan enterprise to cope with change.  Indeed, di ctionary definitions of agility generally include \\nwords such as quick, quick-witted and nimble.  Finally, Goranson (1999) states: \\nA dominant definition of the agile enterprise is  one that responds to (and ideally benefits \\nfrom) unexpected change. \\nWhilst some see agility as a state of mi nd, others focus on methodologies; those who \\nimplement ‘agile’ frequently confuse it with ‘lea n’.  In terms of manuf acturing, lean and agile \\nare different, as pointed out below (Sanchez and Nagi, 2001): \\n‘Lean manufacturing’ developed as  ‘a response to competiti ve pressures with limited \\nresources.  Agile manufacturing, on the other hand, is a response to complexity brought \\nabout by constant change.  Lean is a coll ection of operational techniques focused on \\nproductive use of resources.  Agility is an o verall strategy focused on thriving in an \\nunpredictable environment.  ……  Flexible manufacturing systems (offer)  reactive \\nadaptation, while’ agile manufacturing systems offer  ‘proactive adaptation’.

Excessive di screte planning or documentation should be seen as waste, \\nindeed it is the recombining of ‘thinking’ (planning) and ‘doing’ (following the plan) which \\nleads to agility. \\nAGILE BENEFITS \\nIt is important to verify that agile processe s do actually lead to worthwhile improvements, \\ncompared with traditional processes.  Seven sets  of comparative studies consolidated by Boehm \\nand Turner (2004) illustrate the tr end for a reduction in the effort required to fulfil a project, \\naveraging around 50%.  Further da ta was  obtained from an EC -funded pan-European initiative \\nto identify methods for process improvements; the improvement in organizational skills of 79% \\nresulting from the adoption of DSDM agile practic es was particularly no teworthy (Stapleton and \\nConsortium, 2003).  Finally, an online survey of  131 companies and their perceptions of the \\nimprovements which agile processes offer reporte d improvements or significant improvements in \\nproductivity, quality and business satisfaction.  Just under half of respondents reported \\nreductions in costs (cost reduction is a secondary e ffect of agility as the pr imary focus is on value \\nor, in this context, qual ity-improvement) (Shine, 2003). \\nThe evidence of significant improvements in organisational skills (a bove) provides a starting \\npoint to analysing how agile succeeds.  DSDM, Scrum and other agile processes and methods all \\nemphasise the advantages of communication fl ows within small teams.  Communication is \\nimproved through the use of simultaneous broadba nd paths instead of discrete cascaded \\nmessaging, thus rendering information more immedi ate and better targete d.  Further analysis \\nfollows of how management work structures differ from traditional project management. \\nUNDERLYING RATIONALES FOR AGILE \\nCoping With Emergent Requirements \\nMost projects are volatile and subject to unforeseeable chaotic inputs and  \\nemergent requirements.  This is particularly so in the case of information systems because they \\nare so difficult to visualise (Wegner, 1995)  (Humphrey, 1995) (Ziv and Richardson, 1997). \\nIn the case of construction, rese arch shows that, as late as the start of construction, significant \\nuncertainty remains as to what is to be constr ucted (Howell et al., 1993).   Indeed, other sources \\npoint to the nugatory nature of excessive  front-end design and/or pl anning (MacCormack et al., \\n2003) (Baker et al., 1986 ) (Baker et al., 1986). \\nIf change if so inevita ble and over-specification nugatory, w hy do we try so ha rd to plan to \\nthe last detail and then to follow that plan at all costs?  It is possible th at such a strategy emerged \\nin order to permit a better understanding of co mplexity through decomposition, thus minimising \\nrisk, controlling scope, and en abling measurement of progress.

We can then use project team \\n(including the customer) learning fo r control and feedback.  Thus we are compelled to treat the \\nproject as a process and not as a seri ous of pre-scoped milestones/ gateways. \\nThe emphasis therefore changes from delivery to  a specification within a timescale and \\nbudget, to delivering emergent value within similar constraints.

For exam ple, construction resources are \\nunlikely to remain fixed if scope is changed. \\nMotivational Aspects \\nAnother area of ongoing research concerns the mo tivational impact of agile processes.  On \\ninitial review, methodologies such as Scrum and eXtreme Programming (XP) have common \\nthemes of limiting team effort, whether in terms of scope, time or both.  Further positive \\nmotivational effects of agile processes appear to include the rapid nature of the feedback \\nmechanism, and the supportive nature of interfe rence-free project management.  Thus, at a \\npersonal level, it may be possible to more easily envision and achieve tasks, and to gain positive \\nfeedback. \\nWhilst it seems probable that definition and f acilitation of closer motivational horizons \\ncontributes to agile project succe ss, further research is required on the relative efficiency of the \\ndifferent mechanisms employed.  However, th e following section on human dynamics seems to \\nhave a bearing on the effectiveness of such work organisation. \\nComplex Systems, Network Theory & Human Dynamics \\nThe approach of management-as-organizing (a s opposed to management -as-planning) takes \\nthe idea of human activity as inherently si tuated (Johnston and Brennan, 1996) and thus, \\nplanning should focus on structuring the environment to contribute to purposeful acting.  In the \\nlanguage/action perspective, desc ribed by Winograd and Flores ( 1986), action is triggered by \\nexplicit commitments (promises) resulting from two-way communication. The scientific \\nexperimentation model of control, presented by Shewhart and Deming (1939), focuses on finding \\ncauses of deviations and acting on those causes. The scientific experimentation model thus adds \\nthe aspect of learning to that of control.

Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) developments build upon Ashby’s ground breaking work, together with observations of the \\nnatural world, to provide us with an understa nding of pattern emergence and the need for \\nguidance frameworks, rather than ri gid adherence to rules or plans. \\nThe overall behaviour of a complex system , which we ultimately need to understand and \\nquantify, is as much rooted in its architecture as  it is in the nature of the dynamical processes \\ntaking place on these networks.  We are, ho wever, at the threshold of unravelling the \\ncharacteristics of these dynamical processes.   (Barabasi, 2005b) \\nThe Barabisi model of human dynamics leads us towards an evolving understanding of the \\nnature of human decision making in terms of task prioritization and may eventually help explain \\nwhy restricted task choice can lead to enhan ced human efficiency (Vazquez, 2005).  Barabisi \\nraises the intriguing possib ility that animals also use some evolutionarily encoded priority-based \\nqueuing mechanisms to decide between competing tasks.   (Barabasi, 2005a)  Human activity \\ndoes not follow Poisson distribution but is of a burst nature, followed by a heavy tail; this \\nbehaviour is rooted in the fact that humans assign thei r active tasks different priorities, a process \\nthat can be modelled as a priority queuing system   (Vazquez, 2005). In summary, Barabisi’s \\nresearch may explain why short time periods (suc h as Scrum Sprints) enhance task efficiency; \\nhowever, the implications for agile understanding re quire further research in conjunction with \\nmotivational science. \\nFeedback & Organizational Learning \\nIt could be argued that learning (or the dete ction and correction of error ) in traditional \\nproject management is Model 1 single loop learning, i.e. the deliverables, plans and \\nmethodologies are operationalized rather than que stioned – this is the so-called thermostat \\nmodel. \\nModel 1 Organizational systems  ‘involve a web of fe edback loops that ‘make \\norganizational assumptions and behavioural routines self-reinforcing – inhibiting \\n“detection and correction of e rror” and giving rise to mist rust, defensiveness and self-\\nfulfilling prophecy’  (Edmondson and Moingeon, 1999)\\n \\nOn the other hand, Model 2 learning organiza tions have governing values which include: \\nvalid information, free and informed choice and in ternal commitment.

Doubl e loop learning continues throughout the agile \\nproject through the formal use of iterative de velopment and through the informal learning \\ninherent in small interactive multi-disciplinary teams.  Any Model 2 organisation relies on the \\nsharing of control, design and implementation of  action, using minimally defensive relationships \\nand is in direct contrast to the traditi onal command and control management system and \\nwaterfall development methodologies. \\nHowever, Model 2 organisations would require th e adoption of Japanese or, at least Theory Z \\npractices of collectiv e decision making, employee – employe r relationships and long-term \\nemployment (Ouchi, 1981).  However, the c onstruction industry and its fragmentary and \\ntemporary employment patterns and autocratic ma nagement styles conform more to Theory X \\n(McGregor, 1960) ; even a move towards Theory Y practices of consensual management (Massie \\nand Douglas, 1992) would require substantial industry change.  On the other hand, an agile \\norganisation can be defined in terms of its employment of Model 2 learning and Theory X \\nrelationship practices  and structures. \\nMetaphysical Underpinnings \\nAgile project management can be seen as  ‘management as orga nising’ (Johnston and \\nBrennan, 1996), indeed, an agile project manager is very much seen as a facilitator who enables \\nsmall, self-organising multi-disciplinary teams to  decide for themselves how they satisfy their \\nvalue goals. \\nHowever, it is necessary to understand the deeper foundations, namely the metaphysical \\ncommitments underlying our approaches (Koskela  & Kagioglou 2005).  Since the pre-Socratic \\nperiod of philosophy, there have been two basic views on the metaphysic al (or ontological) \\nquestion: What is there in the world?  One holds that there are things, that  is, atemporal entities \\nin the world.  The other insists th at there are processes, that is, intrinsically temporal phenomena.  \\nThese metaphysical assumptions tend to strongly influence how the subject of the inquiry or \\naction is conceptualized.  The thin g-oriented view seems to lead to analytical decomposition, the \\nrequirement or assumption of certainty and an ah istorical approach.  The process-oriented view \\nis related to a holistic orientation, acknowledg ement of uncertainty a nd to a historical and \\ncontextual approach. The theories discussed ma y be classified according to their metaphysical \\nchoices.  Generally, the traditi onal approach is characterized by a substance (or thing) based \\nontology, whereas the new approaches subscribe to process ontology.  However, the ontological \\nchoices affect the pract ical procedures not on ly through the mediation of theories, but also \\ndirectly.  A project is, of cour se a process and fits neatly in  the area of process metaphysics, \\nhowever, agile thinking and processes cover both management and production theories.

In both domains value is only truly re alised during use,  although it is \\ngenerally easier for an ‘outsi der’ to envision the f unctional constraints and opportunities of a \\nbuilding than those of an information system. \\nOne of the common areas between the two domain s is the need for requirements definition.  \\nIn construction briefing must be seen as a process not an event  (Barrett and Stanley, 1999) and \\nthere are tentative moves towards dynamic briefi ng throughout the project (Othman et al., 2004), \\na particular need for which is s een in the internationalisation of  construction projects  (London et \\nal., 2005). \\nWhilst the need has therefore been recognised for what is essentially an emergent agile value \\ndevelopment process, progress in  its use has not reached the levels of use discussed for \\ninformation systems projects.  Although it has b een reported that appr oximately one third of \\ninformation systems organisations  still use waterfall methods (Lap lante and Neill, 2004), another \\nsurvey reported that over 95%  of respondents would continue to use or would adopt agile \\nprocesses in 2003 (Shine, 2003). \\nAGILE PROJECT MANAGEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION \\nAs Scrum can be considered as a ‘managem ent tool’ (Boehm and Turner, 2004), it can be \\neasily used beyond information systems (its or igins lie in Japanese  manufacturing product \\ndevelopment).  Similarly, DSDM has been used in organisational developm ent and infrastructure \\nprojects and even in construction (Stapleton and Consortium, 2003).  However, these ad hoc uses \\nare not widespread and barriers to wider adopt ion within the constr uction industry remain. \\nIt has been stated that the prevalent theory  of construction is a hindrance to innovation \\n(Koskela and Vrijhoef, 2000), thus calling into question whether new management theory could \\nbe adopted in this domain.  Current constructi on industry structures, de veloped partially to \\nensure contractual risk avoidance appear to be incompatible with Japanese collaborative trust and \\ncorporate and individual learning models.  There t hus seem to be barriers to the employment of \\nagile project management methodologies and thought  processes, in view  of their inherent \\nrequirement for trust and appropriate risk apport ionment (i.e., from a value maximisation, rather \\nthan a(n apparent) financial risk management perspective).  However,  the adoption of agile \\nproject management could probably offer enhan ced construction project values, should adoption \\nprove feasible; although, the sc ale of any potential improvements has yet to be scoped. \\nCONCLUSIONS \\nAgile thinking has a sound basis in both proj ect management and manufacturing in Japan and \\nis currently yielding improved value delivery in  information systems project management.  \\nAlthough a common view of agility is not extant, the core attributes can be clearly stated.  The \\nstructuring of an enterprise or  project to enable it to pro actively respond to change and to \\nwelcome the opportunity that such change a ffords to increase valu e delivery may well be \\nchallenging.  However, there are many apocryphal stories of successful improvements due to the \\nadoption of agile management, though improvement metrics are limited. \\nWhilst agile project management in informa tion systems has obvious parallels with the \\ndesign phase of construction, ther e are considerable differences  in the respective production \\nphases which must be further explored as th e underlying rationales for why agile works are \\nbetter understood.

Anumba1, Patricia Carrillo2 & Jiayi Pan3 \\n \\nABSTRACT  \\n \\nThere is growing interest in knowledge manageme nt (KM) within the ar chitecture, engineering \\nand construction (AEC) sector. KM is seen as vital for ensuring competitive advantage through \\nthe capture and reuse of knowle dge, avoidance of previous mi stakes, reduction of rework, \\nretention of key staff and the timely delivery of knowledge to those who need it. Knowledge \\nmanagement implementation is generally at th e organisational level, project level or both. \\nHowever, there is only limited knowledge management at the personal level. The advent of the Semantic Web provides scope for context-specific  knowledge management at  all of these levels. \\nThis paper explores this, starting with a brief review of developments in knowledge management \\nin construction and then introducing the Sema ntic Web and its underlying technologies. The \\nopportunities for improved knowledge management  based on the Semantic Web are then \\ndiscussed, followed by a description of the a pproach being adopted in the development of \\nmechanisms to take advantage of these opportun ities. A number of conclusions are drawn on the \\npotential uptake of the concepts introduced.  \\nINTRODUCTION \\n \\nIn the knowledge-based economy, the most im portant asset of orga nizations is knowledge \\n(Stewart 1997). An organization’s competitive adva ntage lies in the knowledge residing in the \\nheads of its employees and the capability to harness this knowledge for meeting its business \\nobjectives. Given the growing importance of know ledge in the success and even the survival of \\nan organization, the significance of a system atic or organized knowledge management (KM) \\napproach is being increasingly r ecognized. Scarborough et al (1999) define KM as the process or \\npractice of creating, acquiring, ca pturing, sharing and using knowle dge, wherever it resides, to \\nenhance learning and performance in organisations . It enables “the creation, communication, and \\napplication of knowledge of all kinds to achieve business goals” (Tiwana, 2000). KM, therefore, \\nprovides strategies that help in retaining orga nisational knowledge and organisations that are \\nsuccessful in achieving this will increase profits, lead markets, avoid rework, and have better chances for innovation (Davenport,  1997; Tiwana, 2000; Al-Ghassani et al , 2001a). The true \\npromise of benefits from implementing KM is evident in many cases and this has encouraged \\neven more organisations to adopt KM with many now allocating considerable resources to retain \\nand manage their knowledge. A survey by KMPG (2003) revealed  that the knowledge \\nmanagement practice in the organizations survey ed had improved from one mainly characterized \\n                                                \\n \\n1 Professor and Director, Centre for Innovative and Collaborative Engineering (CICE), Loughborough University, \\nLoughborough LE11 3TU, UK, c.j.anumba@lboro.ac.uk \\n2 Professor, Department of Civil & Building Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough LE11 3TU, \\nUK, p.m.carrillo@lboro.ac.uk \\n3 PhD Research Student, Department of Civil & Building Engineering, Loughborough University, Loughborough \\nLE11 3TU, UK, j.pan@lboro.ac.uk ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Information Technology (IT) has long been rec ognised as critical for successful knowledge \\nmanagement. While it is now recognised that good knowledge management does not result from \\nthe implementation of information systems alone  (Davenport 1997; Stewart 1997), the role of IT \\nas a key enabler remains undiminished (Anumba et al, 2000). The advent of  technologies such as \\nthe Semantic Web provide an opportunity for KM sy stems to be better integrated with the socio-\\ncultural and organisational context within which they have to work. This paper explores the \\npotential of the Semantic Web to facilitate knowledge management w ithin the architecture, \\nengineering and construction (AEC) sector. It starts with a brief review of KM in construction, \\npresents the key characteristics of the Seman tic Web, and then discusses Semantic Web-based \\nknowledge management. The approach being adopted  in an ongoing project is  also described and \\na number of conclusions are drawn.  \\nKNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT  IN CONSTRUCTION  \\n \\nKM practice in construction is mostly informal  and people-centred, alth ough there is a growing \\ntrend towards the development of ‘formal’ KM st rategies within constr uction firms (Kamara et \\nal. 2002a). Other strategies incl ude the development of standa rd operating procedures, best \\npractice guides, communities of pr actice, and codes of practice. These are mostly used within \\nindividual firms, but the great er challenge lies in the manage ment of project knowledge, since \\nthe construction industry revolves around projects. Another dimension that is equally important \\nbut often forgotten is personal knowledge mana gement. These three dimensions of KM in \\nconstruction are briefly discussed below:  \\nPersonal Knowledge Management:  In order to function effectively in their roles, as well as \\nshare their knowledge with othe rs, it is important that cons truction professionals have \\nappropriate systems for managing their personal knowledge. This is an of ten overlooked aspect \\nof KM in construction, partly because it is assumed that most of this knowledge is tacit and held \\nin people’s heads. However, the potential for people to forget, and the need to manage the \\nexplicit knowledge required by an individual for his/her work means that that an organised \\napproach to personal knowle dge management is required. \\n Organisational Knowledge Management:  This is the most comm on dimension of knowledge \\nmanagement that is discussed in the literatur e. The focus is often on how organisations can \\nharness the knowledge that its employees have (making it an  organisational rather than \\nindividual asset) and deploy it in such a way th at it enhances the operational effectiveness and \\nefficiency of the organisation. Many organisati ons rely on the use of intranets, skills yellow \\npages and communities of practice as the key elements of their KM strategies.  Project Knowledge Management: The most common approach used in the industry to capture \\nthe learning from projects is th e post-project evaluati on, PPE (Orange et al. 1999). While useful, \\nthere is evidence that current practice does not provide an effective framework for the capture \\nand reuse of knowledge. PPE is usually conducted individually by organizations involved in a \\nproject and with insufficient time. Furthermore, it does not allow the current project to be ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

There is also the \\nproblem of loss of important information or in sights due to the time lapse in capturing the \\nlearning. Overall, knowledge is not effectively managed at the project organisation level but \\nsome project teams are beginning to address this through provis ions in project extranets. \\n In addition to the limitations of knowledge mana gement at personal, organisational and project \\nlevels, there is the lack of effective mechanisms for the a ppropriate transfer of knowledge \\nbetween these three levels, or  the delivery of knowledge to project personnel based on their \\nparticular context. These lim itations in industry pr actice and the acknowl edged importance of \\nKM have led to various efforts to improve KM in construction. Within the UK, these include the \\nfollowing projects: Cross-sectoral  LEarning in the Virtual enterprise, CLEVER (Kamara et al., \\n2002b), Knowledge Management for Improved Busine ss Performance, KnowBi z (Carrillo et al, \\n2003), K\\nnowledge and L earning I n CON struction, KLICON (McCar thy et al., 2000), Creating, \\nSustaining and Disseminating Kn owledge for Sustainable Constr uction: Tools, Methods and \\nArchitecture, CSanD (CSanD, 2001) and e- COGNOS (e-COGNOS, 2002). Other relevant \\nresearch projects have been undertaken in the US (Reiner and Fruchter, 2000) and in Germany \\n(Scherer and Reul, 2000).  None of the above research projects tackles the knotty pr oblem of knowledge management \\nacross distributed, heterogeneous networks and or ganisations, or the need to support the dynamic \\nenvironment within which most construction pr ofessionals operate. Th ere is scope for the \\nSemantic Web to facilitate in tegrated, context-specific knowle dge management at personal, \\norganisational and project levels within the construc tion sector. This is explored in detail below, \\nafter a brief introduction of the characteristics of the Semantic Web.  \\nTHE SEMANTIC WEB \\n \\nThe Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined \\nmeaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation (Berners-Lee et al, 2001). \\nIt allows the data to be defined and linked in a way that it can be used by machines not just for \\ndisplay purposes but also for automation, inte gration and data reuse. The Semantic Web \\ntechnologies provide intelligen t access to heterogeneous distributed information, enabling \\nsoftware applications to medi ate between user needs and info rmation sources (Fensel, 2001). \\nFigure 1 illustrates the layers of the Semantic  Web Architecture as defined by W3C (URL 1). \\nThese layers are described below:  \\n• XML + NS + XMLschema layer:  XML provides the common syntax, while Namespace \\n(NS) and XML Schema define contents and rules; \\n• RDF and RDF Schema Layer:  RDF (URL 2) is a conceptual da ta layer on top of XML.

Web Ontology Language (OWL) (URL 3) is used \\nas an ontology definition language; \\n• Logic layer:   This defines rules for dynamic inference and definition of hierarchies and \\nprocessing of schemas and instances; \\n• Proof and trust layers:  These involve the rating of sources  and processes, and the monitoring \\nof logical steps. \\n \\nFrom the view point of applications in the construction industry, Semantic Web technologies \\noffer considerable benefits in terms of proj ect management, content and document management, \\nknowledge management, supply chain management a nd integration of dist ributed applications \\nand services (Anumba et al, 2003).

Othe r IT tools for knowledge management have been \\nlimited to supporting knowledge editing, storage, re trieval, and distribution/sharing. Intranets and \\nextranets have proved particularly useful for sh aring explicit knowledge and/or providing access \\nto people with tacit knowledge or shared interests.

The concept is widely promoted as the means of unlocking \\nthe potential of organisa tional resources, mainly knowledge and people, to achieve the strategic \\ngoal of sustained competitiveness. The releva nce of communities of practice, the supporting \\ntheory, benefits and barriers in UK large contracting companies was investigated. Initial results showed variations in the unders tanding of the concept between contracting companies. While \\ncommunities of practice were reportedly successfully applied in one company with strategic intent, the concept was not fully understood in another. The application of the concept of CoP \\nappears to be at theoretical leve l and real examples are lacking. \\nIntroduction \\nThe concept of Communities of practice (CoP) is emerging as one of the most promising \\nstructures for building knowledge -based organizations (Wenger et al., 2002). CoP is rapidly \\nbecoming the key to the knowledge strategy of  a growing number of leading companies, \\ngovernment agencies, and non-profit organisations . Furthermore communiti es of practice are \\nbeing hailed as the driving vehi cle for knowledge transf er and competence development, and its \\nassociated theory has been presented as a bridge  between the theories of  organisational learning \\nand organisational performance (W enger, 1998; Wenger et al., 2002).  \\nUnlike a number of other concepts that have ar isen to address corporate under-performance, such \\nas business process reengineeri ng and total quality management,  which have been labelled as \\n‘fads’, CoP theory appears to ha ve had a much longer period of maturation during the last 14 \\nyears and has finally come to prominence as a re sult of its co-evolution with the theory and \\npractices of knowledge management and netw orking (Wenger et al 2002) and building of \\ndynamic capabilities and competen ces of firms (Zollo and Wint er, 2002; Eisenhardt and Martin, \\n2000). It has gained considerable currency in the field of corporate development because of the \\nemphasis that is now placed on knowledge and people as a competitive assets (Wenger, 1998, \\nPfeffer, 1994, Pfeffer, 1998).  Edwards et al. (2003) in a survey of Knowledge  Management academics and practitioners, found \\nthat CoP represented the second most important concept developed in the literature on knowledge management. CoP is seen is one of the few concepts that take seriously the argument that  people are firms’ best resources (W enger, 1998, Pfeffer, 1994, Pfeffer, 1998, Hunt, 2000). \\nConstruction companies appear to have also real ized the importance of th e application of CoP. A \\nrecent survey of large construction organisations carried out at Loughborough University (Anumba et al., 2005; Carillo et  al., 2002) has shown that CoP’ s are the most widely used \\ntechnique for knowledge sharing. Furthermore A numba et al (2005) have  stated that large \\ninternational construction organisa tions with a range of specialist skills tend to have the greatest \\nneed as well as resources to set up CoPs and to benefit significantly from them.

In classical Greece, for \\ninstance, \"corporations\" of meta lworkers, potters, masons, and ot her craftsmen had both a social \\npurpose in that members worshiped the same deities and celebrated holidays together as well as a \\nbusiness function for training a pprentices to spread innovati ons. In the Middle Ages, guilds \\nplayed similar roles for artis ans throughout Europe. Today\\'s communities of practice are \\ndifferent in one important respec t: instead of being composed primarily of people working on \\ntheir own (not much of a ‘community’, th ey often exist within large organisations. \\nAlthough the phenomenon of Commun ities of Practice have been around for many years the \\nterm itself was not coined until 1991 when Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger used it in their exploration of situated learni ng (Lave and Wenger, 1991). The con cept of situated learning, in \\nwhich the learner and the task are placed in the c ontext of the overall social practice, stems from \\nthe recognition that a traditional view of learni ng as the end result of a process of transmitting \\nknowledge is inadequate. Instead, Lave and We nger (1991) proposed looking at learning from \\nthe learner\\'s perspective and viewing learning as a continuous process in which what is learned \\ndepends on what has been learned before and th e context in which the learner is immersed, a \\nprocess they termed as \"legit imate peripheral participation\". \\nLegitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP) \\nWenger (1999) stated that legitimate peripheral part icipation (LLP) stems from their attempts to \\narticulate that apprenticeship s eems a compelling process of learning. Using LLP they wanted to \\nbroaden the traditional connotati ons of the concept of apprenti ceship from a master/student \\nrelationship to one of changing participation and identity transformation in a community of \\npractice. LPP is both complex and composite and although Lave and Wenger saw LPP as an inseparable \\nwhole, it is helpful to consid er the three aspects—legitimation, peripherality a nd participation—\\nseparately. Legitimation refers to the power and the authority relati ons in the community. \\nPeripherality refers to the individual’s social rath er than physical peripherality in relation to the \\ncommunity. This in turn is dependent on their history of participation in the group and the \\nexpectation of their future participation in and interaction with the community. Thus, a new \\nmember of the community moves from periphe ral to full participation in the community. \\nInitially, activities of the new comers to the co mmunity may be restricted to simply gathering \\nknowledge. Later the newcomer may become invol ved with gaining knowle dge associated with \\nthe specific work practices of the community. Gr adually, as the newcomer  learns, the tasks will \\nbecome more complicated and the newcomer become s an old-timer and is recognised as a source \\nof authority in the community (Wenger, 1999). Lave and Wenger (1991) t hus found triadic group \\nrelations (society or a group colluding togeth er) between ‘masters’ (or ‘old-timers’) and \\n‘apprentices’ (or ‘new comers’) and they argued that the power  dynamics of such triadic relations \\nare different from the dyadic relations between t eacher and student in the context of schooling. \\nNewcomers must learn from old-timers but, unlike students, must also make  a contribution to the \\nwork of the group, typically by doing the simple, routine aspects of the practice.

A social theory of lear ning must, therefore, integrate the components \\nnecessary to characterize social  participation as a process of learning; meaning, practice and \\ncommunity. \\nCommunities of Practice in Organisations \\nBrown and Duguid (2001) describe communities as peers in the execution of real work who are \\nheld together by a common sense of purpose and a real need to know what each other knows. \\nCommunities of Practice (CoP) are a concept that refers to the ways in which people naturally work together. It acknowledges and celebrates the power of informal communities of peers, their creativity and resourcefulness in solving problems, and inventing better, easier ways to meet \\ntheir commitments. Further to the above, three im portant dimensions that define communities of \\npractice are suggested by Wenger (1998) including: The domain : This is what the members care about or th eir area of interest. It may be a skill, a \\nprofessional discipline or a topic.  It must be focused and define d well enough so th at people can \\nidentify with it. They must also have a passion for the area of interest because this is the catalyst \\nthat draws people together. Wenger (1998) obs erves that people orga nize around a domain of \\nknowledge that gives members a sense of join t enterprise and brings them together. \\nThe community : the community is an intricate web of  personal relations of people who know \\nand trust each other. Members do things togeth er which may be social or a work activity. \\nWenger (1998) further charact erises the community as people who function through \\nrelationships of mutual engagement that bind members together into a social entity. Members \\ninteract regularly and engage  in joint activities that build relationship and trust. \\nThe practice : This is how the community works. As  a community work together on their \\ndomain, they create tools, documents, processe s, a common vocabulary, and shared ways of \\ndoing their work. Many communities also solve probl ems that arise in the day-to-day work and \\nmany develop and document best practices. This  shared repertoire created by the community \\nserves as a foundation for future learning. Fo rming a community of practice takes time and \\nsustained interaction. A sense of trust must be developed across these conn ections (the relational \\ndimension) and the members of the network mu st have a common interest or share a common \\nunderstanding.  Peltonem and Lamsa (2004) observe that the id ea of knowledge as the source of competitive \\nadvantage has been celebrated in the management literature for some time. But the understanding \\nof how knowledge emerges and develops in the actual work practices still remains relatively \\nlimited. They further argue that the approach of ‘communities of practice’ offers a relatively coherent view of the social processes of knowledge creation. Th ey thus introduce the \\n‘communities of practice’ approach as a general perspective for making sense of and planning organizational knowledge management programs in a more effective and contextually sensitive \\nway. \\nThe difference between CoP, teams and workgroups \\nA common difficulty met by organisations at tempting to apply CoP are difficulties in \\ndistinguishing CoP from teams or workgroups .

In a CoP it is the knowledge  derived from a common practice that binds \\nmembers together. Wenger(1998) explains that communities of practice are not a new kind of \\norganizational unit; rather, they are a different  perspective on the orga nization\\'s structure–one \\nthat emphasizes the learning that people have done toge ther rather than the unit they report to, \\nthe project they are working on, or the people  they know. Communities of practice differ from \\nother kinds of groups found in orga nizations in the way they defi ne their enterp rise, exist over \\ntime, and set their boundaries. A community of practice is different from a team  in that the shared learning and interest of its \\nmembers are what keep it togeth er. It is defined by knowledge and exists because participation \\nhas value to its members. A community of practice\\'s  life cycle is determined by the value it \\nprovides to its members, not by its parent organisation’s objectiv es. (Fontaine, 2001). It does not \\nappear the minute a project is st arted and does not disappear with  the end of a ta sk. It takes a \\nwhile to come into being and ma y live long after a project is completed or an official team has \\ndisbanded. A community of pr actice is different from a network  in the sense that it is \"about\" \\nsomething; it is not just a set of relationships. It  has an identity as a community, and thus shapes \\nthe identities of its members (We nger 1998). A community of practice  exists because it produces \\na shared practice as members engage in a co llective process of l earning (Fontaine, 2001). \\nThe business case for CoP \\nWenger (1998) observes that CoP fulfils a number of functions with respect to the creation, \\naccumulation, and diffusion of knowledge in an organization: communities of practice are beneficial for the business, for the community itself and for employees. They are powerful vehicles both for sharing knowledge and achievi ng business results. For the Business CoP helps \\ndrive strategy, support faster problem solving both locally and organization wide, aid in \\ndeveloping, recruiting and retain ing talent, build core capabili ties and knowledge competencies \\nand more rapidly diffuse practices for operatio nal excellence. For the organization CoP helps \\ncross fertilize ideas and increa se opportunities for innovation a nd help build common language, \\nmethods and models around specific competencies . It further aid embed knowledge and expertise \\nin a larger population, aid rete ntion of knowledge when employees  leave the company, increase \\naccess to expertise across the company and provid e a means to share power and influence with \\nthe formal parts of the organization. For the i ndividual CoP helps people do their jobs, provide a \\nstable sense of community with other internal  colleagues and with the company. CoP further \\nfoster a learning-focused sense of identity, help  develop individual skills  and competencies and \\nhelp a knowledge worker stay current. \\nThe paradox in managing Communities of Practice \\nBy definition CoP are meant to be organic and emergent structures (Wenger 1998; Wenger et al, \\n2002). These characteristics mean that communities of practice are not easily amenable to top-\\ndown control. Communities of practice are autono mous, self-managing systems, which can exist \\nand flourish without the need for any senior mana gement support. Managerial attempts to control \\nand influence communities of practice may therefore conflict with a community\\'s system of self-\\nmanagement (Wenger et al, 2002). However, desp ite these difficulties a nd potential problems, \\nmore and more organizations are attempting to st art and support communities of practice as part \\nof their knowledge management initiatives. Thus , the risk, in attempting to explicitly manage \\ncommunities of practice is that such attempts ma y in fact have adverse effects on the community, \\nand the very knowledge processes that such effo rts are intended to s upport and develop (Brown \\nand Duguid, 2001).

One specific risk of attempts \\nto formalize a community may introduce rigi dities which inhibit its  innovativeness or \\nadaptability. McDermott (2003) admits that it was originally thought that CoP does not lend \\nitself to topdown approaches. We nger (2002) states that the topdow n approach does not conflict \\nwith the CoP principles as long as knowledge remains as key binding force of the community rather than the task or objective as  set by management for the community. \\nCritique of communi ties of practice \\nMuch of the communities of practice literature presents CoP in a very positive light, suggesting \\nthat in relation to knowledge processes they  are largely or exclusively beneficial for \\norganizations. However while communities of pr actice may facilitate processes of knowledge-\\nsharing, they also have the potenti al to inhibit them. Wenger et al  (2002) highlight that potential \\nproblems may arise from dysfunctional behaviours in  any of the three structural elements. With \\nrespect to the domain, community members may e ither be overly zealous in guarding the domain \\nwhich leads to imperialistic perspective, or lo se ownership over the domain resulting in the \\ncommunity becoming marginalised by the orga nisation. With respect to the community, \\nmembers may bond too tightly resulti ng in egalitarianism.  Rigid conformity to the group leads \\nto mediocrity in performance. With respect to  practice, members may de velop an overly strong \\nsense of competence that leads to dogmatism. The above downsides  are not confined within a \\nsingle community but also in a constellation of  communities as well as the organisation as a \\nwhole.  Hislop (2005) argues that one of the major criticisms of the majority of the mainstream \\nknowledge management literature is the negl ect of issues of pow er and conflict. In Situated \\nLearning (1991) Lave and Wenger do discuss these issues  of power and conflict and their appeal \\nfor future analyses to take greater account of , 'unequal relations of power' within communities \\nhas been neglected by subsequent authors. Fundamentally, communities of practice have \\ninherent tensions built into them which unavoi dably results in them possessing an, 'unequal \\ndistribution of power'. The uneve n distribution of power results from the greater amount of \\ncommunity knowledge masters have compared to newcomers. Thus while communities of \\npractice do not have a formal hi erarchical structure all memb ers of the community are not \\nnecessarily equal. This uneven distribution of knowledge creates potential conflicts in processes \\nof legitimate peripheral participation (Wenge r 1991). Furthermore, Wenge r (1991) argued that \\n'there is a fundamental contradict ion in the meaning to new comers  and old- timers of increasing \\nparticipation by the former. Legitimate peripheral  participation thus requires the 'old-timers' \\nhelping to develop the knowledge of the 'newcomers' who will over time, take their place. Hislop \\n(2005) stated that there are difficulties involve d in attempting to share knowledge across CoPs \\nwhich requires an understand ing of inter-community dynamics. The lack of consensual \\nknowledge and diverging senses of identity that  exist between communitie s represent two of the \\nmost important reasons why such pr ocesses are complex and difficult. \\nCommunities of Practice in the Construction Industry \\nA growing number of people and organizati ons in various sectors are now focusing on \\ncommunities of practice as a key to improving their performance. Examples of communities of practice are found in many organi zations and have been called by different names at various \\ntimes, names such as “learning communities” at Hewlett-Packar d Company, “family groups” at \\nXerox Corporation, “thematic groups” at the Worl d Bank, “peer groups” at British Petroleum, \\np.l.c., and “knowledge networks” at IBM Global Se rvices, but they remain similar in general \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The question whether the construction industry is  a knowledge-based industry or not has \\nbeen a common topic of debate of recent times.  Anumba et al (2005) state that a recent \\nCompetitiveness White paper has defined a knowledge economy as one in which the generation and exploitation of knowledge play a predominant role in the creation of  wealth. Similarly, the \\nOECD report The Knowledge Based Economy  suggests that what is created in knowledge-based \\neconomies is a network society, where the opport unity and capability to access and join \\nknowledge and learning intensive relations determine the socio- economic position of individuals \\nand firms (Anumba et al, 2005). Anum ba et al (2005) go on to state that today’s UK construction \\nindustry progressively moving to wards sharing many of the char acteristics of the knowledge \\neconomy They substantiate this  by stating the following: ‘t he industry is diverse and \\nprofessionally provides a range of services fo r clients, customers and the wider community. \\nConstruction activities can be highly knowledge intensive. Construction products have a high \\nproportion of their development costs attributable  to knowledge-based elements such as design, \\nassessment of cost alternatives of different  components, advice on contractual aspects.  \\nLarge construction firms in the UK are typically s een as hollowed-out organizations in that very \\nfew of them actually carry out the work themselves . Practically all their work is carried out by \\nsubcontractors or by subcontract labour. The larg e firms are thus more involved in managing the \\nprocesses on projects rather than  doing the work themselves. This ha s implications in that if CoP \\nis to be formed to promote knowledge transfer at  levels closer to the workface then this will \\nprobably have to take place with people from different organisations. Secondly it means that \\nlarge contracting firms have limited influence on promoting learning at the levels that work \\nactually gets done. However they have a great deal of influen ce in promoting learning among \\n‘white collar’ workers.  \\nCoPs in large contracting firms \\nThe application of the CoP in contracting companie s is investigated with a case study approach \\ncomplement by questionnaires and interviews. Tw o large contracting companies were selected. \\nCompany A made access to people for interviews and information for analysis easier thus \\nensuring maximum co-operation and willingness to participate. The se lected company A had \\nbeen deemed to be progressive in its applic ation of communities of practice. It was felt \\nundertaking an investigati on within a company quite advanced in their application of CoP could \\npresent a better case for analysis . Company B was chosen for a more  detailed study as a result of \\nits response to the survey questionnaire that was sent out. In its response the company had indicated that the application of communities of practice was an important part of its business \\nstrategy and that it was in a mature state in its ap plication of CoP so it wa s thus thought  to be an \\nappropriate unit of analysis  to facilitate comparison. \\nThe companies that were chosen for the questio nnaire surveys were sele cted from the top 100 \\ncontractors list for 2005 as published by Building  magazine. A large sample size was chosen as \\nresearch indicated that response rates to survey questionnaires ar e normally only ex pected to be \\naround 30%. Survey questionnaires were also sent out to selected email groups. Interviews for \\nthe purpose of the case study were mostly undertaken in a semi-s tructured framework. Whenever \\nit was realised that the person being interviewed had very lim ited understanding of the concept \\nof CoP a number of the questions could not be explored. The only situation in which the entire \\nset of questions was used, was in the interview with the Know ledge Manager from Company B, \\nwhich were using CoP as a key part of thei r knowledge management strategy.

In \\ncontrast Company B has identified  the application of CoP as st rategic and is making deliberate \\nattempts to nurture, support and promote community development. In examining this contrast we will attempt to identify what the underlying reasons are for the differences and also what the possible consequences or implications are for the companies. Further results and discussion on \\nCoP in contracting firms will be shared in future publications. \\nConclusions \\nThe construction industry has often been critic ized for being slow at learning and poor at \\ninnovating. Many construction projects  are lost when a project ends  and a team is disbanded. The \\nresult is that much ‘reinventing of the wheel’ and repetition of past mistakes. Such practices \\ncannot be sustained and have thus ‘latched’ unto the practice of knowledge  management to bring \\nabout change. Knowledge by nature is multidimen sional and cannot be easily separated from the \\ncontext in which it is created. Furthermore pe ople hold knowledge and t hus the social element \\nalso has to be contented with. Communities of pr actice have come to prominence as a result of \\nits co-evolution with the theory and practices of knowledge management and networking. It also \\ngained considerable currency in the field of co rporate development becaus e of the emphasis that \\nis now placed on knowledge and people as comp etitive assets. The appeal of Communities of \\nPractice stems from its roots in the concept of s ituated learning. Situated learning is a theory of \\nlearning derived from studying appr enticeships. The strength in Comm unities of Practice lies in \\nthe ability of communities to negotiate meaning through social relationships.  \\nAlthough the theory of Communities of Practice pr esents a very compelling case for knowledge \\nsharing and knowledge creation, it fails in addr essing power struggles within communities of \\npractice. Indeed the application of CoP warra nts further considera tion by the construction \\nindustry on how its principles can  be applied. There seems to be an underlying paradox in the \\napplication of Communities of practice. Stri ctly speaking one cannot speak of applying or \\nmanaging CoP as by nature and definition they ar e meant to be emergent, organic structures. \\nHowever theory and practice has indicated th at with the correct amount of nurturing and \\nguidance construction organizations ma y benefit from ‘managing’ CoP. \\nReferences: \\nANUMBA, C.

These problems include mistrust, poor communication, and adversarial relationships which \\nadversely affect the performance of  construction projects and the po ssibility of knowledge sharing among \\nconstruction firms (CIRC, 2001). With clients’ ever-increasing demands and the construction industry becoming more and more competitive, partnering has recently been recognized  as one of the ways of \\nimproving the performance of construction projects and meeting clients’ requirements. In addition to \\npartnering, knowledge management ha s also been seen as a way to rema in competitive in the market. This \\npaper aims to examine whether or not partnering could promote and stimulate knowledge sharing. This is done through a questionnaire survey to partnering  as well as non-partnering participants. From the \\ncollected data, comparisons are made between the situation of knowledge sharing in non-partnering projects and that in partnering projects, by analyzing the effects on knowledge sharing due to the characteristics and process of partnering, the identifi cation of benefits gained from the knowledge that \\nwas shared in partnering projects, and the results generated afterwards. The results of the study reveal that \\nthe essential characteristics of partnering, such as mutual trust, enhanced communication, closer relationships, equity, etc. are able to remove major barriers to knowledge sharing, proving that partnering can be regarded as a way to stimulate knowledge sh aring among partnered construction firms. However, \\nthe results indicate that some of the barriers, such as efficiency of communication, and understanding of \\nbenefits of knowledge shar ing as perceived by construction part ies, still need further improvement in \\norder to achieve the best knowledge sharing practices within the construction industry.  Introduction  Hong Kong’s construction industry has for many year s engaged in contractual arrangements that are often \\nbeen described as more adversarial than cooperative.  With this kind of poor relationship among \\nconstruction firms, the performance of construction pr ojects is adversely affected and jeopardizes the \\nsuccess of the construction indust ry as a whole (Larson, 1997).  \\n The effects of bad relationships between construction parties are being recognized, and partnering has \\nbecome an increasingly popular form of business relatio nship within construction over the last decade in \\norder to improve the relationship among constructio n parties (Crane et al., 1997). By analyzing some \\ncompleted partnering projects, many researchers have alre ady proved that partnering  is able to change the \\nrelationships among construction firms from adversarial to cooperative, enhance communications, develop trust within the construction team, improve quality of work, etc. (AGC, 1991; CII, 1991).  \\nThe competition in the constructi on industry today drives compani es toward continuous improved \\nperformance, and companies are showing a growing interest in introducing knowledge management.

However, this kind of sustainable competitive \\nadvantage is not easy to achieve as barriers such as l ack of trust, inefficient communication means, lack \\nof sharing channels, etc. are present in the current construction industry and prohibit the effective sharing \\nof knowledge among construction firms.  \\n This research attempts to examine whether partnering would promote and stimulate knowledge sharing among construction firms. The research objectives include: comparing the current knowledge sharing \\nsituation in both traditional and partnering projects, and examining how partnering would promote and stimulate knowledge sharing among construction firms.  \\n \\nPartnering and Knowledge Sharing  Partnering is a contracting strategy. Its main objectiv e is to encourage contracting parties, the client, the \\ncontractor, sub-contractors, etc. to change from their traditional a dversarial attitude to more co-operative, \\nteam-based relationships. It is advocated as a means of achieving reduced costs and improved \\nperformance by the adoption of information sharing and non-adversarial contract administration, possibly \\ncoupled with incentivization arrangements and shared management controls (Roe and Jenkins, 2003).  There are no fixed definitions used when defining partnering, although common themes/elements prevail \\n(Matthews, 1996).  Essentially the relationship is  based on trust, dedication to common goals, and an \\nunderstanding of each other’s individual expectations and values. Crowley and Karim (1995) stated that partnering can be defined in one of two ways: 1) by its attributes such as trust, shared vision, and long-term commitment, and 2) by its process, whereby partnering is seen as a verb and includes developing mission statements, agreeing goals and conducting part nering workshops. It is clear that the following \\nelements are commonly found in a successful partnering project: mutual goals and objectives (Bennett \\nand Jayes, 1995), equity (Hellard, 1995), trust and sharing (Schultzel and Unruh, 1996), problem \\nresolution (Bennett and Jayes, 1995) and continuous improvement (Bennett and Jayes, 1995).  \\n \\nAwad and Ghaziri (2004) state that knowledge shar ing is the mechanism installed to encourage the \\nsharing of expertise throughout the organization. Ramchandani (2002) defined knowledge sharing as the \\nsocial way and the technical means by which an individual, team, organization and/or community \\nconnects and communicates to continually cr eate, innovate, learn and take action.  \\n The kind of knowledge concerned fo r sharing in a partnering project us ually consists of hands-on skills, \\nspecial know-how that individual parties develop as th ey perform their specialist field of work. This is \\npersonal knowledge that is availabl e for sharing with others. During partnering meetings, knowledge is \\nshared among professionals of different disciplines: this is referred to as ‘i nter-disciplinary knowledge \\nsharing’. The professionals or experts share the ex pert knowledge of their own disciplines, general \\nknowledge and past project experience. “Flow of knowledge is what creates value”, as stated by Buckman (2004), implies that benefits will be gained through proper knowledg e sharing among people. \\nEncouraging people to share knowledge about problems as they arise yields better solutions to those \\nproblems (Buckman, 2004). Giannetto and Wheeler (2000) also wrote that employees who share their \\nbest practice will bring continuous im provement in terms of products, se rvices, their perf ormance, and to \\nthe company as a whole. This means that proper knowl edge sharing within the project team is able to \\nachieve continuous improvement to the project and to each participating company. \\n \\nRamchandani (2002) states that knowledge sharing will not happen if there is a lack of trust  among the \\nemployees. As knowledge is an intangible asset, it will not be recognized as an asset until the value of \\nknowledge is estimated, tracked an d managed. With this kind of lack of visibility of value  of the \\nknowledge and lack of understanding of the benefits of knowledge sharing, people in a project team will not treat knowledge sharing as an important success factor (Ramchandani, 2002).

They further added a knowledge friendly culture, a flexible organizational structure that supports know ledge sharing, support from senior management, the \\ninfrastructure to support knowledge and information sharing, awareness that knowledge is local and \\nsticky and cannot be transferred easily, and recognit ion and rewards. It seems that outcomes such as \\nmutual goals, trust, better relationship, improved  communication means, etc. from “partnering” match \\nwith these critical factors for th e success of knowledge sharing. \\n \\nResearch Methodology \\n The questionnaire survey was selected as the instrument used to collect data. It was used because it is comparatively convenient and enables a large number of  respondents to be obtained: this in turn allows \\naccurate and convincing conclusions to be drawn.  Quest ionnaires were addressed to the target parties by \\nletters, facsimiles and e-mails. The questions were ma inly based on the literature review. The purpose of \\nthis type of question design was to determine the extent of agreement or disagreement from the respondents. In the questionnaire, the respondents were  asked to rank each question according to a five-\\npoint system. In this score system, ‘1’ represented strongly disagreed and was weighted ‘1’ while ‘5’ represented strongly agreed and was weighted ‘5’. Based on the weighting th at was already assigned for \\nrespondents’ choices, the mean scores for each question were calculated.  \\nThe target parties included those companies that had participated in partnering projects.  The received \\nquestionnaires came from clients, designers and cons ultant teams, main contractors and sub-contractors \\nthat had participated in partnering projects. In all, 54 responses were obtained out of the 124 questionnaires administered. This accounted for an over all response rate of 43.5%. Black et al. (2000) \\nstated that a response rate of around 30% is often re ceived from construction indu stry surveys, suggesting \\nthat the response rate of this research is quite high. Of the 54 questionnaires received, 10 of them were \\nfrom clients, 19 from consultants, 18 from main  contractors and 7 from sub-contractors.  \\n Results  \\nThis section aims to compare the knowledge shar ing situation between non-partnering projects and \\npartnering projects in order to find out whether there are any improvements in knowledge sharing through the application of ‘partnering’ arrangements.

This gives an \\noverall view that project team members have change d their attitude towards “knowledge sharing” from \\nunwilling to share their knowledge w ith other project team members in traditional projects to willing to \\nshare their knowledge in partnering projects.  \\nTable 1.

The possible reason  for their change of attitude is that with the mutual objectives of \\nall participants, the pre-agreed problem resolution system and committed continuous improvement to the quality of work in a partnering project, trust and openness has been created among all participants. With the developed trust and openness between each party, all the team members in a partnering project are more willing to share their ideas a nd information with each other as th ey no longer treat knowledge and \\ninformation as commercially sensitive and not to be shared or disclosed to other parties.  \\n From Table 1, it is observed that the contractor team has comparativ ely changed a lot in its attitude \\ntowards knowledge sharing (from the mean score of 2.31 to 3.8). It is not difficult to understand the reasons behind this. As the traditional hierarchical structure of construction projects does not exist in \\npartnered projects, the working relationship is changed from adversarial in the traditional project \\narrangement to cooperation, leading to a situation in which the contractors believe that other project team \\nmembers are more willing to help them than mistreat  them. Besides, “partnerin g” concerns equity: each \\nstakeholder, including those of contra ctor’s interests, needs, expectations, and risks, must receive fair and \\nproper consideration during the creation of mutual goals  and in each partnering meeting. Because of these \\nkinds of essential characteristics of “partnering”, contractors’ teams feel that they are fairly treated, and \\nthe superior positions of client or consultants that existed in past projects no longer exist, thus \\nencouraging them to share their knowledge with other project team members.   Ease of sharing knowledge among project team members  \\nFrom Table 2, the overall score for “non-partnering project” is 2.33, implying that all the participants in \\nnon-partnering projects feel that it is not easy to receive or to accept other project team members’ ideas and knowledge. The mean score for “contractor team” in non-partnering projects is only 2.08: no \\nrespondents chose the answers “strongly agree” and “agree”, which shows that it is very difficult for them to receive or to accept other project team members’  ideas and knowledge.  The results demonstrate there \\nis a major problem in the construction industry. The insufficient and inefficient communication means \\nincrease the chances of abortive works and claims, as the contractors do not receive adequate information and directions during the construction process.  \\nTable 2.

The difference in overall mean score between non-partnering projects and partnering projects \\nimplies that “partnering” arrangements provide a be tter communication environment or means to facilitate \\nthe exchange of ideas, information, etc. The reason for the difference is that “partnering” encourages face \\nto face communication and verbal communications through regular contact in periodic evaluation meetings throughout the whole partnering process, while the traditional project arrangement relies heavily \\non written communication in order for the parties to pr otect themselves from any mishaps in the future. \\nWith face to face communication and verbal communi cations, the ideas and information from others are \\nclearer, faster and easier to receive as compared to those in written communication.

The results have also reflected that there are great problems in the current construction industry, such as the insufficient and inefficient communication \\nmeans, lack of sharing channels, etc. leading to a situation in which it is not  easy to share knowledge \\namong the whole project team. In addition, it is difficu lt to provide information to  the relevant parties for \\nthe execution of their work. This further supports the fact that knowledge sharing among project team members in non-partnering projects is extremely inefficient and insufficient, and needs immediate \\nimprovement.   \\nThe essential characteristics of partnering, such as mu tual trust, mutual goals, enhanced communication, \\nlong-term commitment, closer relationship, equity, etc. are able to remove the major barriers of knowledge sharing, which increases the project participants ’ willingness to share their knowledge with \\nother project team members and ease the transfer of knowledge or ideas among the whole project team. \\nThe results also suggest that the frequency of knowledge sharing among project team members, the \\neffectiveness in providing relevant information to project participants  and the rate of contribution of \\ndifferent parties to solving a problem are all increa sed as compared to the situation of non-partnering \\nprojects. Although the results suggest that partneri ng is able to stimulate knowledge sharing among \\nconstruction firms or construction team members, th ere are some areas that need improvement.

Specifica lly, the paper documents the \\nstudy of 130 construction executives for th eir emotional intelligence and leadership \\nbehaviors as measured by their emotional quotient  (EQ).  The paper establishes a baseline for \\ncritical leadership traits and challenges faci ng the construction industry.  Through the use of \\nestablished testing procedures, the researchers identify five specific components of EI that \\nare related to the leadership of multi-participant construction teams and that reflect the leadership needs identified in leadership trait study.  Of particular importance is the \\nidentification of interpersonal skills and empat hy as key emotional inte lligence behaviors that \\nneed additional attention during the developm ent of construction industry executives.  The \\nauthors put forth that these traits are as important as classical traits of intelligence and experience in developing the leaders of  tomorrow’s construction organizations. \\n   \\nINTRODUCTION \\nThe construction industry of today is both simila r and very different from that of twenty \\nyears ago.  In terms of the former, many processe s, operations, and practi ces have changed very \\nlittle over the last several decades.  While tech nology is slowly modernizing activities such as \\nproject management, field activitie s still have a great resemblance to traditional pr ocesses.  In \\ncontrast, the forces on industry organizations continue  to change at a rapid pace.  Influences such \\nas globalization, evolving delivery mechanisms, a nd changing organizational structures require \\nbusiness decisions that challenge the traditional tr ansactional focus of the industry.  Given these \\nchanging business influences, the issue that is emerging for the construction industry is one of \\nleader preparedness.  One primary concern for th e construction industry over  the next decade is \\nthe development of leaders at all levels of the organization who have the knowledge and skills to \\naddress rapidly changing business environments.  Leadership ability to transform organizations \\nin response to dynamic market forces is essent ial for sustained success within the construction \\nindustry.  Additionally, the ability for leaders to both motivate the internal workforce as well as \\ncommunicate to a diverse project team is a challenge  to individuals to develop their interpersonal \\ncommunication skills.  \\n This paper presents research to esta blish a baseline framework for leadership \\ndevelopment requirements in th e construction industry.

Secondly, the paper discusses \\nmeasuring leadership and emotional intelligen ce behavior of current industry leaders.  \\nFinally, the paper will draw a c onnection between the leadership traits identified as critical \\nfrom the first study with the EQ profile  developed in the behavioral study. \\n  \\nEQ BACKGROUND \\nBeginning in 1970 psychologists began to depart  from what was considered traditional \\npsychology research and desired to study th e combination of intelligence and emotion \\nresulting in exploration into the realm of “cogni tion and affect”. In the decades that followed \\nmore and more research focused on proving th at humans possessed multiple intelligences.  \\nFrom the period of 1990-1993 interest from psyc hologists to research em otional intelligence \\nwas gaining momentum and from this time pe riod the early publications on emotions as an \\nintelligence were introduced.     \\nEI is defined as: an array of noncognitive capabilities, comp etencies and skills that \\ninfluence one’s ability to succeed in coping w ith environmental demands and pressures (Bar-\\nOn, 1997).  Psychologists have b een studying these noncognitive in telligences and have been \\nable to group them into th ree intelligence cate gories as follows (Johnson and Indvik, 1999): \\n• Abstract Intelligence: The ability to unde rstand and manipulate with verbal and \\nmathematical symbols. \\n• Concrete Intelligence: The ability to unde rstand and manipulate with objects. \\n• Social Intelligence:  The ability to  understand and relate to people. \\nThese intelligence categories reflect the idea  of multiple intelligences as introduced by \\nHoward Gardner.  In 1983, Gardner introduced hi s theory of multiple intelligences contending \\nintelligence is comprised of an array of componen t intelligences.  These intelligences included:  \\nLinguistic intelligence, musical intelligence, logical-mathema tical intelligence, spatial \\nintelligence, bodily-kinesthetic  intelligence and personal in telligence (Gardner, 1983).  \\nWidespread attention were gained for the newl y named ‘emotional intell igence’ as psychologist \\nand journalist Daniel Goleman contended that emotionally intelligent people will experience \\ngreater success and satisfaction in life therefor e essentially equating EI with positive social \\nbehavior (Goleman, 1995) \\nSimilar to the efforts of Gardner and Go leman, Reuven Bar-On produced a model of \\n‘noncognitive intelligence’ that included a multifact orial array of emotiona l, personal and social \\nabilities that allow individuals to cope with demands and pressures of their environments (Bar-\\nOn 1997).  These fifteen multifactors fall within  five areas of EI: Interpersonal skills, \\nintrapersonal skills, adaptability, stress manageme nt and general moods.  The factors and the \\nareas under which they fall are illustrated in Table 1. \\nBar-On’s model is multifactorial and relates to potential for performance, rather than \\nperformance itself.  Success is de fined in this model as  “the end product of that which one strives \\nto achieve and accomplish”. (Ba r-On 1997)  Bar-On believes that EQ scores, when combined \\nwith cognitive IQ scores, provide  a better comprehensive indicati on of an individual’s overall \\nintelligence, hence, offering a better indication of pot ential to succeed than relying on one score.  \\nDuring his 19 years of research on EI, he ha s developed the Bar-on Emotional Quotient ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This paper summari zes two of these efforts, the current perspective of industry \\nleaders on leadership and the leadership be haviors of senior construction executives. \\nIn the first of the studies, industry perspect ives, industry executives were surveyed as \\nthey attended conferences and workshops hoste d by the Construction In dustry Institute during \\n2005.  During these meetings, attendees were asked to  fill out the survey to provide insights into \\ntheir own career, their co ncerns for the next generation of i ndustry leaders, and their thoughts on \\nthe challenges for the industry in the near future .  From these requests, 140 surveys have been \\ncompleted at this point.  In the response gr oup, there were 14 females and 126 males with the \\naverage age being 50.9 years.  Th e respondents represen t opinions from large engineering and \\nconstruction firms and as such they should not be interpreted as reflecting the industry as a whole \\nat this time. \\nIn the second of the studies,  the leadership behavior st udy, 155 individuals responded to \\nthe request to participate in th e study out of 400 letters sent to  ENR’s Top 400 contractors list \\n(Butler 2005).  The participants were requested to complete the study us ing a research website \\ndeveloped specifically for this study.  Of these respondents, 130 completed all three parts of the \\nsurvey and could be used in the analysis.  Of the 130 individuals, 96 were employed by ENR’s \\nTop 400 Contractor list.  In th e response group, there were 18 females and 112 males with the \\naverage age being 43.19 years.  The female aver age age was 38.5 years while the male average \\nage was 43.95.   \\nFor the leadership behavior study, participants  completed the most current version of the \\nBarOn EQ-I test.  This is a self -report questionnaire that consis ted of 133 items, all phrased in \\nthe first-person singular.  The re sponse format for these items was a five-point scale ranging \\nfrom “very seldom or not true of me” to “very of ten or true of me.”  These items were used to \\nprovide scores for 21 EQ scales (Bar-On 2000).  Responses to the BarOn EQ-i produced a score \\nfor the Total EQ scale; scores for 5 composite  scales (Intrapersonal, Interpersonal, Stress \\nManagement, Adaptability, and General Mood); and scores for 15 subscales (Table 1).  Raw \\nscores were normalized using norms for the gene ral population of North America.  As such, a \\nscore of 100 points represents exactly average. \\nIn addition to the 21 EQ scales, there were  also 4 scales that assessed the response \\nvalidity of each participant.  These four scales included the Omission Rate, Inconsistency Index, \\nPositive Impression, and Negative Impression scales.  Th e four validity scales were used to filter \\nout invalid responses from the data analysis procedure. \\n \\n \\nRESULTS: THE INDUSTRY  PERSPECTIVE STUDY \\nThe industry perspective study illustrates curren t industry leaders’ pr imary concerns about \\nleadership and future leaders entering the constr uction industry as well as the primary challenges \\nfacing the industry.   Of primary interest in the survey were the sections related to the challenges facing the next generation of industry leaders.  The following sections highlight the results from \\nthe survey. \\nThe first question of the survey focused on what  executives believed were the most important \\nattributes of a leader.  The res pondents were given the opportunity to enter three traits in rank \\norder.  The results of this question were very cl ear in their focus as illustrated in Table 2.  The \\nrespondents believe strongly that th e two most important traits of a leader are in tegrity and the \\nability to interact with others  either through communica tion or interpersonal relationships.

The group’s EI is less va riable with respect to total EQ  than the general population as \\nshown by the standard deviation being less th an the standard deviation for the general \\npopulation.     \\nEI Strengths \\nThe top three EI strengths in the group asse ssed for this study were stress tolerance, \\nindependence and optimism.  Stress tolerance falls under the stress management area of EI, \\nindependence is categorized under intrapersonal skills and optimis m is a component of general \\nmood. \\n• Stress Tolerance:  Many people involved in construc tion would concede there is stress \\nassociated with the majority of jobs in the industry.  There is pressure to complete a \\nproject within a specified time and financial budge t.  In addition there is risk involved in \\nundertaking a construction project because of th e uncontrolled nature of the sites.  Each \\nproject is different and has unforeseen conditions associated  with it.  Also there is \\nfinancial pressure because profit margins are hi storically low reducing flexibilty to make \\nmistakes and still gain financially.  The lead ers assessed in this study have proven to be \\nresourceful and effective as a way to handle st ressful situations.  Th e data shows they are \\ncapable of coming up with suitable methods to  deal with adversity and how to implement \\na plan to alleviate stress.  Additionally, these people overall have a belief in their own \\nability to face and handle stressful situations.   \\n \\n• Independence :The next strongest EI subscale for the group studied was independence.    \\nScoring high in the area of independence means the group has a high degree of self-\\nconfidence as well as the ability to make d ecisions.  As a whole the leaders surveyed \\nhave the ability to think independently as we ll as involve others in  their decision-making \\nprocess.  These are undoubtedly  characteristics strong constr uction leaders need to be \\nsuccessful.  The higher score in independen ce shows that the leaders surveyed posses \\nthese characteristics and are in high positions within their companies.   \\n   \\n• Optimism : Finally, optimism was found to be a strong EI component of the group \\nassessed.  This characteristic measures th e way the group regards the future.  This \\nsubscale may have been different if a ssessed a few years ago when the post 9/11 \\neconomy was uncertain and beginning a recessi on.

The ability  to be aware of, to understand and to \\nappreciate the feelings of others is not necessarily something practiced often in the \\nconstruction industry.  Historically, construc tion leaders did not need to be aware of \\nothers feelings because it was an industry  of “low bidder wins”.  There were no hurt \\nfeelings if one subcontractor was chosen over another because of a lower price.  \\nHistorically construction lead ers did not address issues of  feelings in the workplace. \\n       \\n• Interpersonal Relationship:  The second weakest EI area fo r the group was interpersonal \\nrelationship.  This subscale aligns with empa thy in that it is the ability to form intimate \\nrelationships with others.  Again, this was an  area where the women studied outscored the \\nmen by a large margin.  Construction is not considered a “touchy- feely” industry by any \\nmeans.  As mentioned above, relationships w ith subcontractors were historically based on \\npricing, not how well one “liked” the subcontra ctor.  Construction l eaders did not need \\nthis aspect when they were expected to act as tyrant-type rulers.  Intimate comfortable \\nrelationships were not typically  formed between construction l eader and subordinate.     \\n \\nLeadership Challenge-EI Relationship \\n The EI weaknesses identified in this study ha ve a direct relationship to the required \\nleadership desired traits identified by current indu stry executives.  Specifi cally, as illustrated in \\nTable 2, the need for Interpersonal Skills and Communication are of primary importance to the \\nnext generation of leaders.  Closely aligned with  those traits are the needs to be visionary and \\nadvocate change.  Each of these traits is dom inated by the ability to communicate and develop \\npersonal relationships with organization memb ers.  This emphasis on communication and \\nrelationships raises a red flag due to the fact that the primary EI weaknesses found in industry \\nexecutives are in interpersonal skills.  The weakness in interpersonal skills brings the focus of the analys is to the question of \\nhow is this situation going to be modified in th e next generation of leader s?  It is clear that \\ncurrent executives recognize the need for individual s to possess skills in this area.  However, it is \\nalso clear that a weakness exists in these skills.  Thus, there is an identified need to change the \\npath through which the next generation of indus try leaders are prepared for their positions.  \\nSpecifically, the research identifies that a great er emphasis on interperso nal training is required \\nto meet the identified traits. The challenge to or ganizations will be if this additional emphasis is \\nnot addressed.  If this situation occurs, then th e future generation of leaders may not have the \\nabilities to address issues such as workforce, globalization, and attractin g qualified professionals \\nthat have been identified  as industry challenges. \\n \\nCONCLUSION \\nThe paper summarizes a two-phased investig ation into executive leadership in the \\nconstruction industry.  The first phase summarized  results from an assessment of construction \\nexecutives which queried their views on important  leadership traits a nd construction industry \\nchallenges over the next 10 years.  The chal lenges expressed by industry leaders suggest a \\ncritical need for leadership development.

The paper commences on understanding \\nthe current management perspectives of construc tion industry leaders in change for innovation in \\nNorth Cyprus. The paper concludes how the ch anges in owners’ demands and more complex \\nnew facilities require innovative change initiatives to leave th e old paradigms in construction \\norganizations. Besides technolog y and project-oriented perspec tives, social issues like \\norganizational change and strategic focus on clie nts (market oriented) can be regarded as the \\nmost important change initiatives for the c onstruction industry leaders in North Cyprus. \\n Keywords : Leadership, change initiatives, innovati on, construction contractors, construction \\nindustry, North Cyprus.  \\nIntroduction \\nAgainst a backdrop of increasing globalisation,  deregulation, the rapid pace of technological \\ninnovation, a growing knowledge workforce, and sh ifting social and demographic trends, few \\nwould dispute that the primary task of manageme nt today is the leader ship of organisational \\nchange (Jackson, 1997). Manage rs with a strong influence on innovation processes in \\norganizations have substantial leadership competence (Tatum, 1989; Nam and Tatum, 1989; 1997; Winch 1998; Kim et al., 1999; Norrgen and Schaller, 1999; Ga nn, 2000; Hauscildt and \\nKirchmann, 2001; Stoker et al., 2001; Jung et  al., 2003; Bossink, 2004a). Leadership in \\ninnovative construction projects is  often seen as an important management function, based on \\nhuman capabilities such as entr epreneurship, championship and strategic vision (Tatum, 1989, \\nNam and Tatum, 1989; 1997; Winch, 1998; Gann, 2000; Bossink 2002; 2004a). Managers \\ndriving innovation perform distinctive leadership  styles. Bossink (2004b) emphasized the effects \\nof these styles on the processes in, and the outcomes of innovative construction projects.

Acting out of this \\nparadigm, issues as social-organizational change and strategic focus on the client - regarded as \\nimportant for the industry - will probably not be  addressed properly. Cha nge initiatives could \\ngain in success, when they create wider awaren ess of existence and pers istence of incumbent and \\nprevailing paradigms (Pries et al., 2004).  \\n \\nThe innovation management literature presents leader ship as a role to be performed by managers \\nbut also by employees (Kim et al., 1999; Ha uschildt and Kirchmann, 2001). It typifies and \\ndefines leadership roles such as Inventor , Champion , Entrepreneur, Gatekeeper , Sponsor. The \\nleadership styles of these innovation leadership roles (Harmsen et al., 2000; Waters, 2000; Stoker \\net al., 2001) are Charismatic, Instrumental, Strategic, Interactive. Researchers who explore and \\ndescribe how leading individuals  contribute to the creation of  innovative products, technologies, \\nand organization structures and pr ocesses, often use this innovati on leadership role model (Nam \\nand Tatum, 1997; Rice et al., 1998 ; Hauschildt and Kirchmann, 2001). \\n Construction industry in North Cyprus is aware a nd recognizes the need to modernize in order to \\ntackle the severe problems it is encountering, namely, Profitability, Research and Development, \\nTraining, Price and Cost, Dissatisfaction of Clie nts and Fragmentation. The necessary conditions \\nfor competitiveness for the North Cyprus cons truction industry includ e strong and sustained \\nlevels of productivity growth, openness to innovation and new technology and a commitment to \\ndelivering value for clients’ money. There is growi ng interest in the role of innovation within the \\nNorth Cyprus construction industry (Yitmen an d Al Qadi, 2005; Yitmen, 2005). Driving forces \\nin construction industry indicate that the abil ity to innovate is quickly becoming a competitive \\nnecessity. However construction industry has been  generally slow to embrace innovation and \\nradical changes as fundamental  changes in construction pro cesses require shifts in the \\nconservative management perspectives of construc tion contractors. Thus the strategic leadership \\nhas a crucial role in  change initiat ives for innovation in construc tion contractors. Our research \\nfocus is to investigate the role of strategic leadership in crea ting change for innovation in North \\nCyprus construction industry. Main  objectives are to 1) analyze the current strategic role of \\nleadership in change initiativ es for innovation, 2) identify the innovation driv ing leadership \\nmodels, roles, and styles and 3) assess the eff ectiveness of innovation lead ership models, roles, \\nand styles in constr uction contractors. \\n \\nRESEARCH METHOD \\nTo meet the objectives of the study, a meeti ng was organized by the EUL Civil Engineering \\nDepartment Research Group and representatives from all sub-sectors of the North Cyprus \\nconstruction industry, related inst itutions, chambers, miscellaneous firms etc. were invited to \\ndiscuss the role of strategic l eadership in creating change for constructio n innovation.

As perceived by the respondents regarding the drivers for cha nge within the management \\nperspectives, changes in owners’ demands and more complex new facilities require innovative \\nchange initiatives to leave the old paradigms in construction organiza tions. Besides technology \\nand project-oriented perspectives, social issues like organizational change and strategic focus on \\nclients (market oriented) can be regarded as the most important change initiatives for the \\nconstruction industry leaders in North Cyprus . Figure 1. shows the model framework of the \\nstrategic role of leadership in creating ch ange for construction i nnovation, a North Cyprus \\nPerspective. The driving forces (i.e owners de mand) in construction industry indicate that the \\nability to innovate is quickly becoming a comp etitive necessity. However construction industry \\nhas been generally slow to embrace innovation a nd radical changes as fundamental changes in \\nconstruction processes require shifts in the conservative management perspectives of \\nconstruction organizations. Construction managers  are able to determine the knowledge required \\nfor a particular degree of newness. On the other hand they get support in identifying the \\nknowledge gaps when aiming at a certain inn ovation degree and in choosing an appropriate \\nalternative to close the gaps. However, until no w there has been a lack of validation as many \\nbarriers like old paradigms exis t, thus turning the manageme nt of innovation into a very \\nchallenging task to do. Thus the strategic leadership  has a crucial role in change initiatives for \\ninnovation in construction organizations.  \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.

This complexity of projects is noted by \\nthe International Project Manager’s Associatio n (IPMA) the carries a certification for project \\nmanagers that are able to handle complex projects .

Such \\ncomplex programs and/or projects for the indus try consortia are char acterized by evolving \\nspecifications, rapid technology ch ange and the need to create platforms that can be updated \\nthrough many generations.  The interests of th e consortia cover construction, aerospace and \\nelectronics for both government and private custom ers.  The products are sourced and delivered \\non a global scale.  In these respects, the focu s for the programs may be considered to be \\nrepresentative of the most  technically advanced and complex systems projects. \\n Common characteristics exist for both consortia across all compa ny activities.  In spite of \\nincreasing costs and complexity, customer expect ations are for ever-faster execution at lower \\ncost per function and with greater performance or application effectiveness (faster, cheaper, \\nbetter).  Being able to move c ontinuously along such a multi-dimensional efficiency curve is a \\nmark of corporate leadership.   \\n \\nThe real difficulty, however, lies in being able to sustain that ever-adva ncing metric of improved \\nquality, reduced cost and time throughout many upgrad es in the product/project life cycle with ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Th e monolithic vertically integrat ed corporation is long gone (at \\nleast in the manufacturing sector).   In its place, we have an ex tended supply chain that has many \\nlevels:  \\nTable 1:  Extended Supply Chain \\n \\nLevel Description Example \\n1 Global deployment All Navy communications or  \\nInternational Construction Companies \\n2 Large system entity Building complex \\n3 Product family Interlinked tools or facility campuses \\n4 Stand-alone product Single tool or single structure \\n5 Major sub-system Control system or power distribution \\n6 Functional building block Computer or motor \\n7 Design library component CAD file that can be re-used \\n8 Components Capacitors, frames, boxes \\n9 Refined materials Silicon, steel \\n10 Commodity materials Copper, concrete, lumber \\n \\nToday’s trend finds companies actively seeking to optimize their position in one level and have a \\nfew selected suppliers and major customers dow nstream and upstream.  Although this trend may \\nappear to be heading towards a simpler set of business arrangements, there are sub-layers within \\neach layer in the above table.  Even if each  major enterprise had only 20 accounts (up- and \\ndown-stream), the dependencies in delivery of a high-level system are clearly very complex. \\n  Four additional factors raise the stakes in bei ng a leader at the chosen level in this supply \\nhierarchy:  \\n1.

In the same period, available tools, such as quality control machines, have allowed \\ncommunities with no culture of manufactur ing to enter the high-tech business and \\nproduce quality products. \\n \\n3. Communications and the tools to manage da ta have become cheap.  A world-wide \\nsupply network can now operate as if it were all in one company in one location. \\n 4. These same influences show up in both the construction and manuf acturing arenas when \\ninternational firms set up offices and pr oduction operations in the many countries. \\n These are powerful drivers for change.  One of th e first results has been the continued migration \\nof labor-intensive jobs to develo ping countries.  This is not new as far as basic-technologies are \\nconcerned.  However, the trends above now also allow high-tech jobs to be more readily done \\noffshore which also moves the facility construc tion to developing countries.  The underlying \\nindication then is that construction is labor inte nsive and less expensive to do overseas.  There \\nseems to be every likelihood that other cherishe d monopolistic reserved practices will tumble as \\nglobal resources are harnessed for greater business success. \\n \\nTools designed for another job \\n \\nProject management is one of the oldest professional skills.  From building pyramids to semiconductor factories, a specific job needs to be done within constraints of time, cost and \\navailable skills.  We also know, all too well, th at goals are not achieved, usually due to poor \\nspecifications or slow responses to visible problems.    Unfortunately, with more complex systems and the many interactive co mponents within them, \\ngenerating project or product requi rements becomes a difficult task.  The last job may have been \\nsimilar, but cloning is no solution since the cu stomer’s needs have ch anged and the technology \\nhas improved.  As a result, requirements may only become clear after enough design work has \\nbeen done to define how the new system will function, yet severe time constraints may force \\nprojects to start before all the necessary  information has been assembled.  Global \\ncommunications and terabytes of da ta do not of themselves constitu te sufficient information that \\ncan be used for decision-making.  With a multi- layered global supply chain, problems are often \\nonly visible if they are being actively sought.  T hus all combinations th at are new are usually \\nexcluded and unfortunately, today’s large systems are defined by their new combinations of sub-\\nsystems, components and software.  The conclusion is that the key attributes of today’s complex \\nsystems are also the well-known causes of failure in project management. \\n The tools that are available to support projec t management are great for traditional monolithic \\nprojects where the activities and their interaction can all be fully represented.  However, that is of little advantage if some activitie s are missing because they are laye rs deeper in the supply chain.  \\nSimilarly, the assembly of modules from many s ources is dependent on a common interpretation \\nof standards and specificati ons for their combination.  We should therefore consider \\nincorporation of other tools that more accurately  represent the decision-making steps within a \\ncomplex project.  This means changing the focus fr om known activities to the factors that link \\nthem together.

They initially \\nfeed the integrators who create  the master-plan to tie the co mponents together for the first \\nsystem.  It is then handed over to the support groups.    The cycle continues as the sy stem matures in service with  many upgrades and technology \\nadditions.  Then, however, it is the sustaining gr oup who takes on the role of customer advocate \\nand initiator of change specifica tions.  This is a much larger role than such groups have \\ntraditionally enjoyed - but where better to start to define the evolution path?  In the first cycle, the integrator’s role was concer ned with strategic design.  In th e mature system evolutionary \\nstages, the integrator has to abstract the lessons  passed on by the sustainers and make sure they \\nare effectively transferred to the next job.  The individuals in all three roles have the difficult \\npersonal task of taking different  leader and support  roles throughout the system life cycle. \\n Although these roles may be spread across severa l companies, the customer does not separate \\naccountability according to contribut ions.  If successfu lly done, the system provider can lock in \\nbusiness for years or even decades.  However, any system integrator that does not attend to designing out today’s problems will likely find that bidding for the next generation contract is much more challenging.  The development path for such professional skills does not yet exist in the mainstream \\neducational system.  However, it is currently being explored through short courses and industry-\\nled cooperatives to provide specific solutions.

JACMET (led by \\nBoeing, Honeywell, Raytheon, Motorola and Gene ral Dynamics) deals with electronics and \\naerospace manufacturing while CREATE’s member co mpanies (led by Intel) are devoted to the \\nconstruction of advanced technol ogy facilities with highly contro lled environments and many \\ncomplex systems.  Both consortia provide short c ourses to their industry members and are tightly \\nfocused on the skill priorities of  their member companies.  One of the long-term goals in being \\nassociated with a State University is to tran sfer industry experience in to both the content and \\nstrategic direction of academic programs.  Both consortia have similar concerns about reti rement of many senior technical staff in the \\nmember companies and the need to prepare the next generation of leaders quickly for more \\ndemanding tasks ahead.  The first-tier  solutions are similar – to esta blish a series of short courses \\nthat can lead to a certificate.  In the case of CREATE, the devel oped graduate courses have been \\nutilized to develop an on-line training program for project managers in the Asia region that have \\nno understanding of the complexities of an adva nced technology manufacturing facility.  The \\nprogram, with a practical appli cation of concepts taught, has pr ovided a methodology to learn the \\nunique skills needed for constructing a high tech  factory while minimizing the impact on their \\ncurrent workload, remaining within travel limitations and still providing an excellent learning environment  \\n The JACMET solution is a certificate program for potential Chief Engineers that covers the changing role, systems design, re quirements specification, decisi on-oriented risk management, \\nroot cause analysis, reliability and how to make a business case.

A value-based process model \\nincorporates aspects of lean thinking and partnering with emphas is on the individuals \\ncontributing to the project and the management of  their interaction practices. Value is seen as the \\nend-goal of construction projects and therefore the discussion and agreement of value parameters \\nis fundamental to the achievement of improved pr oductivity and client/user satisfaction. This is \\nachieved primarily through the use of creative workshops in which the main actors come \\ntogether to discuss and agree a set of value pa rameters. Workshops are coordinated and managed \\nby a process facilitator; a person who plays a key role in the development of projects but who has \\nno contractual responsibility for the outcome of the process. This ‘informal’ leadership role is crucial to the successful devel opment and delivery of projects using a model in which great \\nemphasis is placed on people and their collective abil ity to work together. Thus the facilitator has \\na socialising function running para llel to project management f unctions; a role fundamental to \\nsuccessful leadership and collaboration between organisations  and individuals. \\n \\nKeywords: Communication; Culture; Informal lead ership, Lean philosophy; Value-based \\nmanagement.  \\nINTRODUCTION \\nLike many construction sectors around the world the Danish construction sector was heavily \\ncriticised during the 1990s for its poor performance and fail ure to deliver value to the customer, \\nalthough parallel research found th at some innovative practices were being implemented across \\nthe sector (Kristiansen et al, 2005). More recently a number of initiatives have been taken to try \\nand improve the value delivered to clients a nd building users. Con cepts such as lean \\nconstruction, partnering and more recently value management have been promoted as ‘the’ way \\nto better performance. These management fashions have been adopted and adapted by organisations to fit their organi sational culture, with varying degrees of success. The current \\nsituation in Denmark is a very fluid constructio n market, with actors cl aiming to use different \\napproaches to distinguish themselves from the competition and improve performance.  At the level of the individual construction pr oject it may be very difficult improve working \\nmethods even when all participants and organisa tions ‘sign up’ to some common values.

The implication is that \\nthe sharing of values is a challenge for orga nisations and temporary project groupings. The \\nchallenge is not exclusively with the implementati on of tools to streamline the process, more it is \\nabout the interaction of organisations, or more specifically the efficacy of relationships between \\nthe actors during the project lifecycle. This soci al interaction needs to be managed and someone \\nhas to take responsibility for leading the process.  \\n Communication, cooperation, competences and values  of actors are vital components in helping \\nto achieve integration and synergy. To do this eff ectively all actors must engage in dialogue to \\nexplore and then confirm a set of values that form the basis of th e project, and the most effective \\nway of doing this is through face-to-face meetings  that recognise the value of group process \\n(Luft, 1984). The value-based model described in  this paper relies on th e ability of project \\nstakeholders to reach consensus. Value is seen as  ‘the’ end-goal of all construction projects and \\ntherefore the discussion and agreement of value pa rameters is fundamental to the achievement of \\nimproved productivity and client/user satisfaction. In this model the ro le of the process facilitator \\nis key to project success. He or she has no cont ractual responsibility for the content of the \\nproject, but has a signif icant role to play as an inform al leader. The work is based on a \\nlongitudinal case study (started in March 2003) th at has followed the development of a ‘new’ \\nway of working by a large contract or working closely with a larg e firm of consulting engineers \\nin Denmark. Data collection has mainly been via non-participant observa tion of meetings and \\ninterviews with project particip ants. This has been supplemented with written documentation and \\nanalysis of a small number of indepe ndent research reports on the method.  \\n \\nCASE-STUDY - A VALUE-BASED APPROACH \\nThe value-based building process model has develope d through a series of trials, starting in the \\nearly 1990s. The aim was, according to the actors in terviewed, to develop a better approach to \\nthe design and construction of buildings through a ttention to the process. This has been done \\nthrough small pilot projects, interaction with the academic community in Denmark and advice \\nfrom consultants from within Denmark and ab road, notably from the UK and the USA. Early \\nmodels were based on logistics and lean produc tion thinking, which has been further evolved \\nthrough a focus on value, partnering, integrat ed teamworking and gr eater attention to \\ninterpersonal communication. Influe ntial literature is cited as Miles (1972), Porter (1985), \\nWomack et al (1991), Kelly & Male (1993), Koskela ( 2000) and Ballard (2000). From a Danish \\nperspective value-based management attempts  to control values; primarily through value \\nmanagement to ‘create’ value in the early stag es of the project and vi a value engineering to \\n‘deliver’ value in produc tion (Christoffersen 2003). \\n \\nGetting to know each other and thus establishi ng common values and/or knowing why values \\ndiffer between the stakeholders is crucial to th e value-based method and gi ves some sense to the \\npartnering philosophy. It is about how to work toge ther and how to keep agreements between the \\nclient and the delivery team. Establishment of common objectives and common values are \\nimportant objectives in the drive for greater c ooperation and reduced c onflict in construction \\nprojects (e.g. Kelly & Male 1993).

Interconnectivit y places pressure on th e ability to communicate and share information \\nand knowledge. Interpersonal co mmunication, intra-organisationa l and inter-organisational \\ncommunication is particularly pertinent to the establishment of an effective project \\ncommunication network (Emmitt & Gorse 2003) and also for enabling learning to take place \\nwithin the project, helping to improve end va lue. Architects Konrad Wachsmann and Walter \\nGropius introduced a teamwork method for the deve lopment of complex building concepts in the \\n1940s; with the teamwork approach once again fashionable (see Emmitt et al, 2004). Interactions \\nwithin groups, power relations hips, leadership and decision- making are extremely complex \\nmatters and contradictory views exist as to the ab ility of a group to reach its defined goals (e.g. \\nStroop 1932, Yoshida et al 1978, Emmitt & Gorse 2003). In the case study model workshops are \\nused to encourage face-to-face interaction, with the aim of helping actors to understand the \\ncultural values of others. The goal is better inte gration and realisation of  project values. This \\nplaces considerable pressure on the process facil itator to manage the workshops effectively and \\ntease out the different value sets.  \\nThe workshop sequence  \\nWorkshop 0: (Partnering) Build ing effective relationships \\nThe function of the preliminary workshop is to bring various actors toge ther to engage in \\nsocialising and teambuilding activities. The inte ntion is to build the communication structures, \\nthe system architecture for the project, thus allowing actors to engage in open and effective communication during the life of the project, the architectural dial ogue. In addition to setting the \\nstage for the events that follow the ‘outcome’ of  the first workshop is th e signing of a partnering \\nagreement, which confirms the process values for cooperation. Early workshops are also \\nconcerned with the selection of the most approp riate consultants; evalua ted on their ability to \\ncontribute to the project (their ‘fit’) rather than the lowest fee bid. Collective dialogue helps to \\nexplore and develop relationships  that can (or conversely cannot) develop into effective and \\nefficient working alliances.  Workshop 1: Vision It is not possible to know values in depth at the start of a proj ect, so workshops are primarily \\nconcerned with exploring values and establis hing a common vision. Knowledge and experience \\nfrom other projects is brought into the works hop, for example from facilities management. The \\nmain focus of the effort is the establishment of  client values (value-based parameters); on the \\nbasis that the better th ese are known the better the team can deliver. Collective dialogue helps to \\nexplore and develop interpersona l relationships that can (or conversely cannot) develop into \\neffective and efficient working alliances. Cri tical connections between  decision-making are \\nexplored so that everyone is cert ain of roles and responsibilities. The result of Workshop 1 is the \\nestablishment of basic values for the project; a very pragmatic document of prioritised values, \\nwhich does not contain any drawings.

Project economy is introduced here along \\nwith restraints imposed by, for example, author ities and relevant codes. Design proposals are \\nworked through and ranked according to value. Architects are encouraged to produce at least \\nthree schemes that can be presented and discus sed. Two to three workshops are required because \\nthere is a lot of material to di scuss. Basic project values and project economy are respected in \\nthis process and any changes justified within th e value parameters. The outcome of the realism \\nphase is the selection of the ‘best suited’ proposal. \\n Workshop 3: Criticism The proposed design solution is criti cised; is it really the ‘best’ solution? Could it be ‘better’? \\nDiscussion is centred on the chosen solution and its improvement within the value parameters. \\nUncertainty and urgency is high on the agenda prior to the scheme entering the production \\nphases. Client (stakeholder) satisfa ction with the process value and the product value is measured \\non the base of the partnering agr eement and the basic product value parameters. Then the project \\nis approved for production and the contra ctual delivery specifications fixed. \\n \\nWorkshop 4: Design planning It is here that there is a shift in thinking, as the more abstract work turns into production \\ninformation. Values are concerned with delivery. The designers, contractor and sub-contractors \\ninterface most here as value management techni ques turn more toward value engineering and a \\nprocess management tool is introduced to help gu ide the planning of the pr ocess and results in a \\nprocess layout of the design pro cess similar to the process plan in construction. A lot of decision-\\nmaking still remains related to production activities,  which are dealt with by the main contractor, \\nworking closely with the sub-contractors. \\n \\nWorkshop 5: Buildability Here the focus is on improving the constructability of the project, while trying to reduce waste in \\nthe detailed design and construction phases by ha ving the designers and the foremen/craftsmen \\nmeeting with this specific value in mind giving their input to improving the design or focus it on \\nthe competences of the actual production capability and capacity.   Workshop 6: Planning for execution Workshops involve interaction between the main contractor and the sub- contractors. A process \\nplan is produced that helps to map the vari ous production activities and help identify missing \\ninformation. Information flow is an important cons ideration at this stage.  On completion of the \\nconstruction schedule, in an idea l world, the information should be complete and there should be \\n‘no scope’ for uncertainty of the deli vered value at the production phases. \\n \\nPractical issues \\nThe term workshop is used, although in practic e this will comprise a series of facilitated \\nworkshops that deal with a particular issue, or  value stage, which continue until agreement has \\nbeen reached.

Flexibility in programming is required to \\naccommodate the inherent uncertainty in knowi ng exactly how many workshops will be required \\nto reach agreement and hence move forward. When problems with understanding and attitudes \\nexist, additional workshops are convened to he lp explore the underlying values and tease out \\ncreative input. The whole proce ss is consensus based. Bringing pe ople together and facilitating \\nworkshops is time consuming and expensive, but pr oven to be cost effectiv e over the project life \\ncycle.  Workshops are ‘value generators’ or ‘value dr ivers’ and are concerned with problem framing. \\nDelivery of client value is ach ieved between the main works hops, where the problem solving \\ntakes place. Project team meetings are held betw een the formal workshops to discuss and agree \\nprogress. The number of participan ts present in the meetings vari es between projects and stages, \\nhowever numbers typically range from between 15 and 30 people. Workshops never last longer \\nthan one working day. The schedule of meetings ma y be extensive on a larg e project and there is \\na concern that the cost of the meetings may out weigh the value realised through them. All parties \\nto the project need to constantly  monitor the effectiveness of the meetings and critically assess \\ntheir added value through the use of various benchmarking tools. Th ere is the constant danger of \\nholding too many workshops and the participan ts becoming jaded though over-familiarisation. \\nThere is considerable pressure on the process faci litator to keep the actors together and thus \\nprevent entropy. It is also cri tical that the process manager and design manager are able to \\ncommunicate effectively on an inte r-personal level. There are two types of communication in the \\nworkshop model; namely, workshop communica tion (to establish values) and process \\ncommunication (to implement values). It is cr itical that the actors  are aware of these \\ncommunication levels.  A ‘demand’ of the project philosophy is that all ke y stakeholders are represented from the start to \\nthe finish. A standard value agenda is used  as a framework for decision-making in the \\nworkshops, based on six key areas of value; Beau ty; Functionality; Durability; Suitability (for \\nthe site and the community); Sustainability (res pect for the environment); and Buildability. This \\nvalue hierarchy addresses the primary project ob jectives and breaks them  down into further sub-\\nobjectives as part of an iterativ e process carried out within the workshops. Each area is explored \\nuntil the value parameters have been mutually ag reed through the use of the Value Tree. Tools \\nlike quality function deployment (Q FD) can also be used to weight  options (values) in a decision \\nmatrix to help find the solution that provides the best value. A pro cess facilitator guides \\nparticipants through the disc ussion of values in a systematic and objective way. \\n \\nTHE FACILITATOR’S ROLE \\nA characteristic of the model is the role and cont ractual responsibility of the process facilitator. \\nThe process facilitator plays a ke y role in scheduling and facilita ting the meetings. He or she has \\nno contractual responsibilities and is  not at liberty to contribute to  the discussions, merely to try \\nand ensure that all participants have equal participation rights. T hus the facilitator acts as an \\ninformal leader, charged with creating an effec tive social system that can drive the project \\nforward based on consensus.

During the early meetings the facilitator is \\nprimarily concerned with creating a harmonious atmo sphere within the workshops so that actors \\nare able to communicate and share their values, w ith the hope of reaching agreement. Conflict is \\nmanaged to ensure that any disagreements are dealt with in a positive manner. Indeed, criticism is encouraged. The facilitator’s role changes as  the workshops proceed, with priority given to \\nkeeping the team together during difficult discus sions in the later stages when cost and time \\nbecome the focus of the discussions. With no formal  ‘power’ the facilitator has to build trust and \\nrespect within the project team  to enable the workshops to function effectively. Moral support \\nfrom formal managers, e.g. the project manager and the design manager, as well as the client is \\nessential in this regard, helping the process facilit ator to function as an effective informal leader. \\nThe process facilitator must possess excellent in terpersonal skills and have sufficient knowledge \\nof construction to be able to guide the process,  allowing sufficient time fo r discussion, but by the \\nsame token knowing when to prevent unnecessary talk around the subject.   Success of the process-facilitated workshops wi ll be coloured by to a large extent by the \\nexperience and skill of the facilitator.

Observations have revealed instances when participants have come to the \\nmeeting unprepared (for example cost information was not circulated before the meeting). This \\nhas the effect of causing a certain amount of tu rbulence within the team and in the meetings \\nobserved resulted in the need for another worksh op to be scheduled. In such situations the \\nfacilitator speaks to  the ‘problem’ participant( s) outside of the works hop environment to try and \\nencourage better performance in future meetings. Ob servation has also revealed that a great deal \\nof informal communication takes place before an d after the formal workshop sessions. Driven by \\nthe process facilitator, the aim is to encourag e the formation and rete ntion of interpersonal \\nrelationships.  It is common for the client to employ the process facilitator directly to re present their interests, \\nalthough in the examples observed by the author th e contractor has paid for the facilitation role \\nbecause it is seen as a more cost effective approa ch in terms of the complete life cycle of the \\nproject. The perception of the proj ect participants is that the faci litated process saves them time \\nand money in the longer perspective, although it has not been possible to se parate this out from \\nother project factors and hence quan tify it in financial terms. There is a widely held view in the \\nDanish construction sector that females make better facilitators than their male counterparts. This \\nperception appears to co me from strongly held stereotypes about specific roles in a very \\nconservative construction sector. There has not been a ny research undertaken that may help to \\nconfirm or dispel such views. Women are perceived to be bette r at communicating and to have \\nbetter social skills then males. Scientific rese arch, based on some form of comparison between \\nmale and female facilitators would be helpful to s ee if differences between facilitators are related \\nto gender and/or other factors.  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

First, it has to be implemented \\nvery early in the project and all key actors must  sign up to the approach. There have been some \\nexamples where the facilitated wo rkshop method has been applied la ter in the process, and these \\n‘insertions’ have proven to be in effective despite the efforts of the facilitators. Second, is the \\nproblem of scheduling the proce ss accurately to coincide with  project management programmes \\nand specific milestones. The number of workshops  required to ensure a ll participants reach \\nagreement on the project value parameters can ea sily exceed that planned since the method is \\ndriven by consensus. For projects with very tight frameworks such uncertainty can present \\nproblems for the project management team. Third, the model is very sensitive to the social skills \\nof the process facilitator and also to all participan ts signing up to such an approach. This must be \\nagreed and to a certain extent driven by the client  for the approach to work effectively. Fourth, \\nthe model only works when all participants enga ge in open communication, and his takes a shift \\nin thinking for many of the participants who ar e more familiar with adversarial practices and \\nclosed (defensive) communication practices.  The creative workshops appear to encourage open communication and knowledge sharing, with \\nlearning as a group contributing to the clarification and conf irmation of project values. \\nAccording to the participants the clear percepti on is that the workshops encourage integration \\nand teamwork. Although the worksh ops act an informal control ga te, there is no formal set of \\ncontrol gates (unlike other proce ss models) and the participants do not use a quality management \\nsystem. Some consideration of more formal pro cedures in line with total quality management \\nmay be a useful tool for future implementati on of the model. This may help the process \\nfacilitator and project managers to coordinate programmes a little better.    Improvements brought about by the model have b een confirmed in a small independent study \\ncarried out by the Danish Building Research In stitute, which found improved performance across \\na whole range of performance parameters (By og Byg, 2004; SBi, 2005). In addition to this the \\nmembers of the project have consistently eval uated the process highly, finding it an enjoyable \\nand productive way of working (although as stakehol ders in the project one would expect this \\nsort of response because it is difficult to cr iticise one’s own contribution). Further work is \\nrequired to investigate the eff ectiveness of, for example, the workshop method in terms of the \\nrealisation of group goals. In particular, the role of the workshop method in promoting and \\ndelivering creative solutions woul d be a logical extension of th is case study. A related area of \\nresearch relates to the skills and competences of the process facilita tor, not just in facilitating the \\nmeetings but also as a socialising function of  project management. So me investigation of \\ninterpersonal communication skills (task-based and social-emotional)  may also be useful avenues \\nto explore in terms of educatin g/training process facilitators.  \\nReferences \\nBallard, G.

As the ar chitecture, engineering, and \\nconstruction (AEC) industry develops the strategi es and technologies for these projects, an \\nincreased emphasis must be placed on the engin eering competencies required to deliver high \\nperformance buildings. This places  a challenge squarely at the f eet of the engineering community \\nto adopt a more prominent leadership position in high performance projects. Presently, engineers are not the drivers of high pe rformance buildings, despite th e technical content in these \\nbuildings. The consequence is sometimes substandard  or high-cost solutions to green challenges. \\nThis paper starts to provide a systematic an alysis of the challenge s to and opportunities for \\nengineering leadership on high performance build ing projects. Through a nu mber of high profile \\nhigh performance building projects, these ch allenges and opportunitie s are explored, and \\nsolutions explained. The results point to the vital role of engineering inge nuity and leadership to \\nthe success of high performance projects. \\nIntroduction  \\nEnvironmentally sustainable building is a vi tal emerging market in the architecture, \\nengineering and construction (A EC) industry. High performance \"green\" buildings are reducing \\nthe environmental and economic footprint of buildings by minimizing energy use, reducing \\nresource consumption and waste, and providi ng healthy and productive environments for \\noccupants (US DOE 2003, Smith 2003). This is vita l given that buildings consume 36% of total \\nenergy use, 30% raw material use, and 12% of potable water in the U.S. (Roodman and Lensen \\n1995). Public and private owners alike see these buildings as solutions to their facility and \\ninfrastructure needs. By giving tangible and m easurable recognition to environmental building \\nfeatures, the Leadership in Ener gy and Environmental Design (LEED) system has been critical to ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The integrated design process places great \\ndemand on the design team because intense interdis ciplinary collaboration is needed to ensure \\nthat building systems are synergistic and “right sized.” The analysis of envelope, lighting, and \\nmechanical systems for example, can no longer ta ke place in a sequential manner, but must be \\ncompleted in an integrated fashion using advanc ed analysis and simulation tools that permit the \\ninterplay between these systems to be understood and optimized. \\nThe types of collaboration required in integr ated design environments necessarily involve \\nthe engineering and construction community. Sp earheaded largely by the architectural design \\ncommunity, integrated design practices have  not always taken optimum advantage of \\nengineering and construction expert ise. For example, mechanical co ntractors can help to specify \\nequipment that is best suited to a given sized facility and often provide  independent advice on \\nwhich equipment is superior to operate and main tain. Yet, early models of integrated design do \\nnot even involve contractors in the process. Cons equently, substandard or high-cost solutions to \\ngreen buildings have occasionally occurred. \\nThe prevailing strategies for high performan ce building projects present an opportunity \\nfor the engineering community to  enhance their leadership in the design and construction of \\nthese projects. Strong engineering leadership on these projects often brings rigorous and well \\nthought through solutions that ul timately lead to a superior  facility for the owner. \\nThis paper begins to identify opportuniti es for engineering leadership in high \\nperformance building projects based on our research  experiences in sustainable project delivery. \\nThe paper is a synthesis of some of the result s garnered from our research conducted through the \\nLean and Green Research Initiative at Penn State. \\nRole of Engineering  \\nEngineers play a vital role in the potentia l success of high perfor mance green buildings, \\nespecially those where energy efficiency and indoor air quality are priorities. Apart from \\nadvising on building layouts that maximize ener gy efficiency, engineers advise on systems \\navailability and optimum configurations, comp lete energy and lighting analyses, and conduct \\ndetailed analyses to ensure that building syst ems are synergistic and “right sized.” Engineers \\ndevelop building façade details and specify su stainable building materials, both critical \\ndimensions of high performance buildings. Engineer s are often the source of innovative solutions \\nto complex challenges. For example, an induc tion AC system designed by the design-build \\nmechanical contractor was used in renovating th e Pentagon in order to resolve space congestion \\nproblems competing with daylight penetration requi rements, and first cost and life cycle cost \\nneeds. Engineers provide importa nt cost and estimating servi ces during design, and technical \\ndetails needed to make sound design decisi ons.

The \\nLEED rating system makes many inherent assumpti ons about the needs of the project, including \\nthe use of alternative fuel vehicles, additional commissioning requirements, and life cycle costing in material comparison. A dhering to these strategies might assist the project in achieving \\nLEED certification, but the long-term sustai nability benefits remain in question. \\nThe additional commissioning credit (EA Credit 3) introduces the independent \\ncommissioning agent to the project team. An i ndependent commissioning agent can add value by \\nensuring the building systems are meeting the ow ner’s needs, however, ex perience shows this \\nlevel of commissioning rarely occurs. In satisf ying the LEED requirements for this credit, the \\nagent must review the submittals to ensure the design requirements are met, not the owner’s \\nrequirements. In other words, the added leve l of commissioning makes an implicit assumption \\nthat whatever has been designed is what the owner needs. This is not always the case, and so this \\nadded commissioning does not add value to the pr oject, and seems to do little to enhance the \\nsystem’s ability to provide the occupa nts with a healthy indoor environment. \\nCurrent techniques for life cycle analysis of green materials are not sufficiently rigorous \\nwhen they assess building system function. While a green material may compare to conventional \\nmaterials under design conditions, their capabi lities outside design conditions are often \\nunknown. These conditions often pose a threat to green materials, i.e., water on bamboo flooring, \\nwhereas a ceramic or vinyl tile can overcome such conditions. \\nQuestions are also present about the true sust ainable impact of a LEED certified facility. \\nSimply, this has not been studied  and consequently is not rea lly known. Furthermore, questions \\nare also being posed about the merits of a syst em that allows a building to be certified as \\nsustainable without seriously addr essing any energy efficiency or i ndoor air quality credits in the \\ndesign or construction. \\nOpportunities for Leadership  \\nLEED has been a catalyst for raising the awareness of environm entally sustainable \\nbuilding. It has been a ready system for bu ilding owners and users suddenly aware of \\nconsumption with sharply rising energy prices. The weaknesses present are not fatal, but in fact \\nhighlight the opportunities for leadership by engi neers on high performan ce projects. Engineers \\nare able to address many important  technical issues and help owne rs weigh benefits and costs in \\ntheir decision-making. Engineer s are strong systems thinkers, who understand that a decision on \\none issue has repercussions on others. This section outlines the opportunities for employing engineering competencies to help steer a project to superior sustainable outcomes. \\nDelivery Selection and Strategies.  The ways project teams are procured, contractual \\narrangements are enacted, and team members incentivized to work collaboratively in an \\nintegrated fashion are known to impact project cost, schedule and quality outcomes. However, \\nthere is growing evidence that these issues also  affect levels of build ing sustainability. For \\ninstance, project teams experienced in delivering sustainable projects are able to deliver green \\nbuildings at costs approaching conventional buildings (GSA 2004).

In the current environment, e ngineers and contractor s are being involved \\nincreasingly early in projects, and can advise owners about alte rnative project delivery methods \\nand innovative teaming strategies to maximi ze opportunities for gr een project success. \\nIntegrated Design.  Projects where engineers either part ner with the architect or drive the \\nintegrated design process themselves, seem to  demonstrate better design success through fewer \\ndesign flaws and more timely design progress. This seems to be because the engineering \\ncommunity has a better handle on the challenges and processes of integrated design than the \\narchitecture community. This may well be the resu lt of the differences in training and education \\nreceived. In particular, engineer s often recognize the need for ke y competencies at key points in \\nthe design process, e.g., energy a nd lighting analyses, which is vi tal to a successful integrated \\ndesign experience (R iley et al. 2004). \\nProcess Management.  Levels of delivery process waste a ffect project cost s and levels of \\nsustainability achieved (Horman et al. 2006). Conse quently, there is a need to have a competent \\nchampion of the process, and for that champion to  be dedicated to delive ry process innovations \\n(Lapinski et al. 2006). \\nCase study projects in which design-build mech anical services were acquired to address \\nunique and challenging project c onditions provide examples of how the combination of design \\nand construction competencies enabled cost sa vings and energy efficient mechanical systems \\ndesign solutions. Examples of up to 20% initial costs savings combined with improved overall \\nenergy efficiency in design were found on seve ral case study projects (Riley et al. 2005). \\nIn an integrated delivery process, engineer s can apply lean principles to identify waste \\nreducing and value-added activitie s in the conception, design, fa brication, and construction of \\nprojects. In the case of progressi ve design-build mechanical contra ctors (DBMC) three trends are \\nbeginning to emerge: \\n1. DBMC are often willing to adopt te chnologies and innovative solutions, \\n2. Integrated design and detailing expertise possessed by DBMC leads to both first cost \\nand long term energy cost savings, and \\n3. Early involvement of DBMC in the design process to  address challenging project \\nconditions adds significant value to the project. \\nIn the domain of project delivery processes, the weaving of lean principles and green \\ndesign solutions is revealing a strong case for the closer manage ment of the delivery process on \\ngreen building projects (Huovila and Koskela 1998, Lapinski et al. 2006). Timely integration of \\nengineering competencies with fabrication and constructability knowledge  creates a tremendous \\nopportunity for unique and innovative solutions that are able to re duce schedule, initial cost, and \\nlife-cycle cost while providing high er quality sustainable buildings. \\nPrefabrication.

However, if employed properly, many gr een benefits can also be achieved through \\nprefabrication, such as safer working conditions, reduced environmental impact, more efficient \\nuse of labor and materials, and better quality control. Furthe rmore, the rapid technological \\nimprovements in the manufacturing industry and th e increasing supply chai n integration in the \\nconstruction market make it possible and eas ier to extract these potential values. \\nA need exists for project teams to fully unde rstand the synergies and tensions between \\nprefabrication, building processes, and building performance at an ea rly design phase. If this is to \\nmature, engineering needs to continue to i nnovate the use of prefabrication and to adopt \\ndecision-making models early in design to ev aluate the potential for prefabrication when \\nflexibility remains open for decision-makers. Comp lete designs leave very little flexibility for \\ncontractors to wisely employ prefabrication due to  the difficulty in influe ncing methods that are \\nembodied by early design decisions, and as a resu lt, the value of prefab rication is often limited. \\nContinuous Value Enhancement Process (CVEP).  The task of delivering high performance \\ngreen facilities is more difficult than for trad itional projects and exis ting project management \\ntechniques struggle to handle the high levels of  complexity present. In particular, current \\nengineering and project management  strategies fail to provide an opportunity to discover and test \\npotential solutions in a systema tic way. Tools like CVEP have been developed to enable project \\nteams to systematically discover new and innovativ e solutions on sustainabl e projects (Pulaski \\nand Horman 2005). When engine ers and project managers us e tools like CVEP, numerous \\nopportunities are identified to simultaneous ly improve both project performance (i.e., \\nconstructability) and increase sustainability (Pulaski and Horman 2005). \\nOperations and Maintenance Input.  While increased attention is now placed on the operation \\nand maintenance (O&M) of a facility in sustai nably designed buildings , we are far from being \\nable to optimally inject O&M information in pr oject design. “Operating e xpenses represent over \\n95 percent of building life cycle costs, yet ope rations and maintenance personnel are usually the \\nlast to be consulted during pr ogramming and design” (NIBS 2003). Facilities engineers, with \\ntheir wealth of knowledge in th e operation and maintenance of building systems, are at the \\nforefront of being able to provide independent advice on th e life-cycle performance of \\nequipment. Working closely with engineers of project delivery processe s (e.g., project managers) \\nas well as architects and design engineers, the engineering community can add significant value \\nto the life-cycle. Critical to ongoing success here is to learn when the right O&M information is \\nneeded in the design and construction processes. \\nFurther Research and Conclusions  \\nIn many high performance green building projects, engineers hold the keys to \\neconomically delivering high-valu e sustainable buildings. Howeve r to do this consistently, \\nengineering needs to take an in creasing leadership role in the design and construction of these \\nbuildings. This paper articulated six areas where engineering can adopt a gr eater leadership role \\nto advance the high performance nature of the facility. These included: Delivery selection and \\nstrategies; integrated design;  process management; prefab rication, CVEP, and O&M input. \\nGarnered from ongoing research by the Lean and Gr een Research Initiative at Penn State, the \\nareas identified are the start of a systematic assessment of the lead ership opportunities for ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Engineers \\nproduced by the current education system are qua lified for leading sustainable building projects. \\nHowever, continuing with the traditional approach  to engineering, where gi vens are accepted and \\nstandards are designed to, is not optimal for sustainable building pe rformance. Engineers, similar \\nto architects, should be encouraged during th eir education to be innovators, or building \\nperformance will continue to meet standards and never achieve the advances that are possible. Innovative engineers will provide more proficient leadership on  sustainable projects, becoming \\nthe linchpin of building design, ra ther than being a group that he lps the architect’s design to \\nfunction. It is important to l earn about how to enc ourage this innovation in  the education of \\nengineers. \\nAlso critical is the development of an unders tanding of how to educ ate engineers to be \\ncontributors and leaders in in tegrated design environments. The traditional paradigm for \\nengineering education divides stud ents into specialties (electrical , mechanical, structural, etc.) \\nwhere they are isolated and focused beginning at an early stage in their academic careers. \\nClearly, the in-depth technical knowledge of a specific engineeri ng discipline is essential to \\ndeveloping quality engineers. Still,  it is becoming apparent that the future model for engineering \\neducation should include more inte rdisciplinary design integration to  best develop engineers that \\ncan contribute to and lead sustainable design projects. Progressive en gineering programs are \\nalready attempting strategies to encourage this interd isciplinary design inte gration, so it logical \\nto examine which are most effective in preparing engineers to be capable leaders of the integrated design process. \\nReferences  \\nDOE.

The focus is on human and \\norganizational aspects of implementation, because  they appear as key aspects for successful \\nimplementation. \\nA strategy that promotes collaborati on among companies was selected to reduce \\nimplementation barriers and to facilitate action research. To introduce permanent changes in \\nmanagement practice, training was one of the main  aspects of the strategy.

This process of change has four main elements that are key for the dynamic of change:  \\n1. Alliances among companies to improve the effi ciency as a group working together.    \\n2.

The factors were identified through direct observat ion and with the aid of two \\nsurveys applied to all the participants at diffe rent stages of the implementation. The factors \\nidentified are discussed in the following paragraphs. \\nTime \\nThe main difficulty in the implementation according to the participants was the lack of \\ntime for implementing new practices in the pr ojects that were alr eady under way.

The lack of time for implem entation affected the rigorousness and extend \\nof implementation. As a result, partial im plementation, intermittent implementation and \\ninsufficient preparation of the planning meetings  was often a problem. This situation had an \\nimpact on the effectiveness of the system and increased the need for more time for \\nimplementation.  More recently, the use of time  by project manager has been studied more \\nthoroughly in order to deal with th is issue (Alarcón and Pavez, 2006) \\nTraining \\nAccording to the studies carried out, the second difficulty, in order of importance in the \\nimplementation, was the lack of training. The trai ning activities seek to deliver the necessary \\nknowledge to allow project pers onnel to carry out  implemen tation. These activities had an \\nadditional importance, because according to th e persons involved (Alarcón and Seguel, 2002), \\nthey were key to convey motivation and commitmen t to the process. In order to respond to the \\nindividual needs of each sector of  the organization, distinct traini ng activities were  carried out, \\ndirected to different actors, and with different  modalities and objectives.  One key activity was \\nthe training of “coaches” to prepare people within  the companies to support the implementation \\nin order to achieve some autonomy and to diminish  the need of external aid.  The role of this \\npeople has reinforced the implementation and cons olidation of the Lean planning tools in the \\ncompanies. \\nOrganization \\nTo respond adequately to th e challenge of implementing th e LCP, it was necessary to \\ncreate or strengthen some organizational elem ents. The internal organization for a company \\nimplementation requires the active presence and involvement of upper management in some of \\nthe key activities.  The implementation of an in ternal committee, including some top executives \\nand people with leadership  skills, became a requirement.  This  committee responds to the need of \\ndeveloping an implementation strategy at the company level with monitoring and control \\nmechanisms  to introduce and consolidate the ne w practices. At the project level, the total \\nsupport and leadership of the proj ect managers turned out to be a fundamental aspect that made \\nthe difference between success and failure in the efforts of implementation.  The main \\norganizational aspects related with the effectiv eness of the implementation were (Alarcón and \\nDiethelm, 2001): (1) discipline of the implemen tation (with an orderly methodology), (2) early \\nimplementation of the internal committee, (3) quality of the communications present in the \\nimplementation site and (4) commitment from upper management clearly visible to all the \\nemployees. \\nParallel Implementation With Other Improvement Programs \\nParallel improvement efforts in lean pla nning and other improvement programs such as \\nquality management, risk prevention and reduc tion of environmental im pact usually run in \\ncompeting tracks.

The constant changes introduced a \\ngreat deal of variability a nd uncertainty to almost all the planned activities.  \\nHuman Elements have a Great Impact \\nDuring the application of LCP, diverse hum an factors became important barriers that \\nobstructed the efforts of implementation and affect ed the team synergy.  However, some of these \\nweaknesses were used to strengthen the implemen tation in early phases. The barriers identified \\nin this environment are discusse d in the following paragraphs \\nThe role of site/office manager \\nDue to the hierarchical organization that char acterizes the Chilean construction companies, \\nthe project/site managers and/or  department managers, in case of  central offices, were very \\nimportant in the implementation process. They exercise leadership, they are important in the establishment and removal of ba rriers and they are the link w ith middle management. In most \\ncases when the commitment of the manager was obtained, a successful implementation was \\nachieved.  A central issue in the role of the site /officer manager was their leadership and the way \\nfollowed to incorporate the different hierarchi cal levels existing into the company in the \\nimplementation effort (Alarcón and Diethelm, 2001). \\nThe importance of commitment \\nOne of the major aspects that trigger all LCP implementation process was commitment, \\nfirst from upper management then from site/officer  manager and then from all the employees that \\nhad a relation with the program. It worked lik e a waterfall where decisions, motivations and \\ncommitment were flowing down from the higher hierarchical positions to the rest of the \\norganization including in most cases site operative workers that  had to carried out \\nimplementation tasks. \\nResistance to Change \\nOne of the main obstacles to defeat in order to achieve a successful implementation, is the \\nfear of change. This problem was made eviden t by symptoms such as the early refusal to \\nassuming commitments, or refusal to include subc ontractors in planning meetings or negative \\nreactions to the theoretical concepts of LCP and to  its application in the project. A research to \\nidentify the elements that motivate change was carried out, in order to facilitate the \\nimplementation of lean techni ques (Alarcón and Seguel, 2002).

For example in \\nthe implementation of Last Planner System (Ba llard and Howell, 1998), initially the problems of \\nnon completion were associated exclusively with subcontractors and owners or designers. This \\nsituation did not allow the compan ies to take advantage of the oppor tunities to take improvement \\nactions within the own contractor  organization.  In this case, se lf questioning can be transformed \\ninto the first occasion of improvement. \\nShort Term Vision \\nShort term vision does not allow people to visualize problems with enough time to make \\nthe right decisions. This was an obstacle, for ex ample, to implement the look-ahead  plans in \\nseveral projects.  However,  in  projects located at a long dist ance of the provi sion centers, the \\nreal benefit of Look-ahead plans wa s really appreciated.  In projec ts in these conditions, due to \\nthe distance and accessibility of mean s of transportation,  the actions to free restrictions had to be \\nat least with six weeks of an ticipation. This experience serv ed like example to the other \\ncompanies that had been slow in implementing look-ahead planning. \\nOrganization Development Needs \\nAs showed above, there were some factors th at hindered the implemen tation and they were \\nclassified as “barriers to the implementation”. Taking into count these barriers, and with the \\nexperience acquired in five years of implementation of LCP, comp anies realized that the major \\nproblem in these implementations had been rela ted with cultural and organizational aspects. \\nAfter several years of LCP implementation, the mechanic vision of the improvement \\ncentered in specific improvement tools has changed towards an organic view of the \\nimprovement, where the central elements are the human and organizational issues. This change \\nof view, motivated the companies to guide their collaborative stra tegic efforts about LCP for the \\nnext two years to an organization development  program (French and Be ll, 1996) that  included \\naspects like: review of the role  of project managers, review of their performance evaluation \\nsystems, redesign of their organization to ac hieve LCP goals, review or redesign of their \\nincentive programs and the develo pment of a professional traini ng program for all levels, to \\nbecome a “lean organization”. \\nThe organizational development work began wi th an organization di agnosis that showed \\nthe precarious existing systems to manage the human resources in these companies (Alarcón, \\nPavez, Bascuñan and Diethelm, 2005). Some results of  this diagnosis were: lack of procedures to \\nstructure the site-organization, poorly defined f unctions, poorly defined in centives polic ies, lack \\nof formal procedures to deve lop performance evaluation and poor information flow to lower \\nlevels of the organization.

Michael Toole1 \\n \\n1 Assoc. Prof., Civil & Env. Eng., Bucknell Univ., Le wisburg, PA 17837.  570-577-3820.  ttoole@bucknell.edu. \\nAbstract \\nThe fact that people play key ro les in nearly all aspects of construction suggests that effective \\nconstruction research requires pr oper application of social scien ce research methods.  This is \\nparticularly true for researcher s studying leadership in construc tion.  After reviewing the existing \\nliterature on construction research methods, six principles of social  science research methods are \\npresented and illustrated using theoretical and actual examples from past research.  \\n1. A mixture of research approaches is appropriate. \\n2. Terms and concepts must be explicitly defined. \\n3. Theoretical concepts must be measured carefully. \\n4. Hypothesized causal relationships must be stat ed explicitly but are difficult to “prove.” \\n5. Proper statistical analysis is critical; \\n6. Proper research design must be perf ormed before data are collected. \\n \\nKey Words:  Research methods, leadersh ip, social science, data analysis. \\n \\nIntroduction \\nConstruction can be defined as the applicati on of technology to achieve goals involving the \\nerection or retrofitting of infrastr ucture and buildings.  This defi nition implies that the focus of \\nconstruction research should be on technologies a nd constructed facilities.  Yet the actions of \\npeople underlie every aspect of construction.  A more accurate de finition of construction would \\ntherefore be “the application by people  of technology developed by people  to achieve goals \\nestablished by people  involving the erection or re trofitting of infrastructure and buildings.”  The \\nfact that people play key roles in nearly a ll aspects of construction suggests that effective \\nconstruction research requires the proper application of soci al science research methods.  \\n The number of papers presented at this and the 2004 leadership conf erence suggest that \\nleadership is an important and growing topic in cons truction research.  Indeed, leadership may \\nrepresent a strategic area of research for our community because our civil and environmental \\nengineering (CEE) colleagues are in creasingly realizing that CEEs need to focus on leadership to \\nrestore the stature of our profe ssion in society, and the construction community is in the best \\nposition to lead the way.  To serv e as effective leaders in explici tly incorporating leadership into \\nthe CEE profession, we must not only incorporate l eadership into our curriculum, we must also \\nperform effective and important research on l eadership within the c onstruction industry.   \\n It is the author’s opinion that some construction graduate stude nts and faculty pursue research \\nwith methodologies that inappropria tely ignore the human element im plicit in leadership and in \\nmany areas of construction practice.  Other c onstruction research area s in which the human \\nelement plays a particularly critical role and require social science re search methods include \\ntechnological and organizational innovation, st rategic management, knowledge management, \\nemotional intelligence, and cont ract partnering.

Gradua te research projects \\ntake longer than expected and produce results that disappoint their f aculty advisors.  Such \\nresearch typically adds little to  the stream of research because  the research concepts remain \\nvague and reported statistical re lationships are suspect.  Perhap s most importantly, ineffective \\nresearch methods diminishes the respect that ot her disciplines and funding agencies hold for the \\nconstruction research community, resulting in research on leadersh ip and other important topics \\nnot being funded.  While the use of inappropriate construction research methods is  unacceptable, it is also \\nsomewhat understandable.  The majority of cons truction researchers are engineers, not social \\nscientists.  Our coursework and work experi ence has prepared us to be good engineers and \\nperhaps good construction manage rs, but not to conduct research  involving human behavior.  \\nWhen it comes to research methods, many of us do not know what we do not know.  That is, we \\nare not aware that we are lacking perspectives an d skills necessary for our research goals.  On the \\nother hand, some of us have realized what we  are missing in our rese arch tool box, yet have \\nclung stubbornly to our normative wo rldview and failed to invest the time and effort to “fix” \\nourselves.  More damning, we have failed to insi st that our graduate st udents who are performing \\nconstruction research involving social scien ce adequately prepare themselves to conduct \\neffective research.  The goal of this paper is to serve as a primer  on research methods for construction research \\ntopics involving social science.  It is intended not only for new construction doctoral students but \\nalso for construction facu lty performing research in social science areas of construction for the \\nfirst time.  This paper represents  a contribution to the literature not because it represents cutting \\nedge research, but because it applies principles found in existing literature to the focus of this \\nconference and provides a summary of  critical research issues that does not currently exist.   \\n The paper’s structure is rather st raight forward.

To illustrate th e principles, a hypothetical leadership \\nresearch question will be used as an example.

It is this author’s perception that a \\ntypical practice in construction is  to distribute surveys to large samples via the postal service, \\nemail or a website, perform statistical analysis on  the data collected and to supplement the survey \\nwith interviews before or after the survey.  Another common method is to do a detailed case \\nstudy of one issue within a firm, or mini-case studies of four to  twelve firms.  The research \\nmethods books suggest our discipli ne would benefit from more et hnographic studies, especially \\nin research areas still in the e xploratory stage.  There have been  a few “insider’s story” books on \\nspecific construction trades and major projects but these have not met the standards of true \\nethnographic research.  It is rec ognized, however, that most constr uction researchers have neither \\nthe time, desire nor capability  of doing ethnographic studies. \\n \\n2.  Terms and concepts must  be explicitly defined \\nThe meanings of most engineering terms are una mbiguous.  Stress, flowrate and viscosity, for \\nexample, are well understood across the e ngineering community.  Many construction \\nmanagement terms, on the other hand, are somewhat imprecise, with meanings that vary with individuals and with contexts.  Fo r example, leadership may be c onsidered to be the ability to \\narticulate an organizational vision, to mobilize resources towards a set of goals, to motivate \\ncoworkers to perform at their best, to enact change, or to establish systems that enable \\noperational efficiently.  Simila rly, technological innovation may be  thought of as creating new \\ntechnologies, adopting new technologies, transfor ming processes through a new type of system, \\nor establishing a culture of embracing anyt hing based on new technology.  Effectively \\nresearching many construction management research  topics requires the research to explicitly \\ndefine their theoretical concepts (referred to as “constructs” in social sc ience) as early in the \\nresearch as possible and to maintain a uniform de finition from literature search through reporting \\nthe results of the research.  A key aspect of defining a construct is determ ining whether it is an  individual, group or \\norganizational concept.  Emotional intelligence, fo r example, is clearly an  individual trait.  \\nEffective teamwork is a group construct.  Corpor ate financial performance is an organizational \\nconstruct.  Some constructs, such as leadership, ca n be associated with more than one level.  For \\nexample, we say an individual can exhibit good le adership skills over his or her subordinates, a \\nteam can exercise leadership by suggesting im proved procedures within a firm, a firm can \\ndemonstrate leadership by introducing a series of new products in a market.  Similarly, the \\nconstruct of knowledge management involves behavior s at the individual level as well as a set of \\ncollective behaviors that repr esent knowledge management at the group and firm levels. \\n It should be noted that the two principles di scussed thus far apply to both qualitative and \\nquantitative research methods.  The remaining prin ciples are applicable mostly to quantitative \\nresearch involving statistical analysis.

Theoretical concepts must be measured carefully \\nMost engineering terms have a standard method for measuring a value associated with them.  \\nUsing the examples listed earlier, stress, strain and viscosity all can be measured using specific \\ntypes of equipment and a range of procedures su ch that any engineer wo uld agree the resulting \\nvalues are accurate.  Many construction manageme nt concepts are neither uniformly defined nor \\neasily measured.  Consider our hypothetical hypothe sis, that successful lead ers ensure their firms \\nare technologically innovative.  How do we iden tify a leader in an organization?  Are all \\nindividuals holding certain titl es (President, Chief Financia l Officer, Water Resources Group \\nManager) leaders?  Do all leader s in an organization have one of these titles?  If we focus our \\nstudy on individuals who are Vice Presidents or higher, how should we measure the success of \\neach leader?  Should we ask the individuals themse lves if they are succe ssful leaders?  Should \\nwe ask their bosses or subordinate s?  Should we seek objective arch ival metrics that demonstrate \\ntheir organizations were recently successful, such as  unit profits, growth in sales, productivity, or \\nreported customer satisfaction?  Identifying appropriate ways to me asure constructs, i.e., appropriate indicators, is critical to the \\nsuccess of an empirical social science study be cause the portion of variance in a dependent \\nvariable explained by an independent  variable is usually so low.  (In other words, correlation is \\ntypically low.)  Poor indicators in essence contain random noise that may mask a statistically \\nvalid relationship.  The author is aware of a doctoral student  who spent many hundreds of hours \\ncollecting data from a large sample of construc tion firms for the stude nt’s dissertation.  The \\nhypotheses were important and inte resting, pilot interv iews seemed to indicate the hypotheses \\nwere accurate, and a reasonably large number of fi rms provided survey data.  The research plan \\nseemed sound other than concern voiced by th e doctoral committee about the quality of the \\nindicators.  Ultimately, the results were statis tically inconclusive, apparently because the \\nindicators did indeed not capture well the underlying constructs. \\n The reliability of many social sc ience indicators is particularly low for indicators that are \\nreported, not archival data.  Social  scientists generally agree that archival indicators are preferred \\nover reported indicators because the latter are inherently subjective and may reflect biases and \\ninaccuracies.  For example, self-re port indicators often reflect that most people have an inflated \\nopinion of their own abilities.  Answers about othe r people or issues are often biased because the \\nrespondents fear answering the question truthfully may lead to trouble with their boss or \\ncoworkers or will disappoint the researchers.  Our example hypothesis requires an indicator fo r successful leaders and an indicator for \\ntechnological innovation.  It seem s reasonable to define a successf ul leader as one who manages \\nhis or her company to financial success.  One set of potential indicator s would be asking the \\nindividual and those who know this  individual (bosses, subordin ates, stakeholders, competitors) \\nwhether this individual is a successful leader or ha s lead his or her company to financial success.  \\nThe reader can probably appreciate  these reported measures may very well be biased in some \\nway.  Potential archival measures include the firm’s  growth in sales, net income or earnings per \\nshare, but these are typically only readily ava ilable for publicly traded companies.  Reported \\nfinancial data for private companies (i.e., “Wha t was your firm’s net income last year?”) are \\noften considerably less accurate than true archival indicators.

In fact, some social scientis ts unapologetically identify some constructs as \\nlatent constructs, meaning they cannot be measured  directly by one or mo re indicators (Loehlin \\n1998).  Structural Equation Modeling is a relatively re cent statistical tool that  uses factor analysis \\nof multiple indicators to measure latent variab les.  Molenaar et al (2000) provide a good \\nexplanation of the use of Structural E quation Modeling in co nstruction research. \\n \\n4.  Hypothesized causal relationships must be stated explicitly but are difficult to “prove” \\nEssentially all research should start with at least one meani ngful research question, which \\ntypically leads to at least one hypothesis that is investigated th rough an empirical study.  Most \\nhypotheses are causal in nature, th at is, they posit that one or  more independent variables \\ninfluence one or more dependent variables.  Ma ny scientists—social or otherwise—adhere to \\nfour requirements for proving causality.  First, there is a plausible theoretical explanation \\ncausually linking the two variable s.  Second, there is evidence th at the hypothesized independent \\nvariable precedes the de pendent variable in time.  Third, ther e is objective statistical relationship \\nbetween the two variables.  F ourth, plausible alternative expl anations for the statistical \\nrelationships can be dismissed thr ough discussion (Cook and Campbell 1979) \\n It is this author’s opinion that many constr uction researchers typica lly do a decent job of \\nachieving the first and thir d criteria but not the second and four th.  Most construction researchers \\nhave heard the saying that corr elation does not equal causalit y, yet fail to acknowledge that \\nregression only presumes causality; it doesn’t pr ove it.  The challenge to achieving the second \\ncriterion is that it usually  requires us to conduct experi ments involving individuals and \\ncompanies, which is problematic.  (Imagine the responses you would receive if you asked ten firms to participate in a research project in which five firms were directed not to adopt \\ntechnological innovations while fi ve firms were told to adopt innovations in order to later \\nmeasure differences in profits between the two fi rms.)  Leadership researchers typically measure \\nboth the independent and depende nt variables simultaneously and presume the former has \\ninfluenced the latter.  For example, we might  measure a firm’s innovation level and a firm’s \\nfinancial performance at one point  in time and presume that i nnovation has contributed to the \\nfirm’s financial performance.  An astute colle ague, however, might argu e the causal relationship \\nis reversed, that is, that a firm’s financial su ccess provides them with slack resources that allow \\nthe firm to be innovative.  The example above points at the importance and difficulty of achieving the fourth criteria, \\nrejecting alternative explanations for any statis tical relationship found be tween two variables.  \\nBecause we are rarely allowed to manipulate in dependent variables and control other variables \\ninvolving humans, spurious relationships are a co nstant issue in social  science research.  A \\nspurious relationship exists when two variables are correlated because both are causally related \\nto a common independent variable.  For exampl e, if we were to measure the technological \\ninnovation levels and financial performances of 100 construction firms and found the two \\nvariables to be highly correlated, it may be that the correlation actua lly reflects the fact that both \\nvariables reflect the size of th e firm, i.e., large firms are both innovative and achieve higher \\nprofit margins. \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The graphic that indicates this process \\nis a nomological net , which is somewhat like a table with  the columns being the independent and \\ndependent variables in the hypothesis and th e rows being the successive layers of \\noperationalizations.   \\n One value of a nomological net is that it may re veals when we are inappropriately mixing levels \\nof analysis in our constructs or our indicators.  Our exampl e hypothesis inherently contains \\nmixed levels of analysis because it involves indi vidual leaders and their firms.  This is not \\nnecessarily a problem until we identify whether an  individual is a successful leader based on the \\nleader’s company’s financial perf ormance.  If our data sample includes the President and three \\nVice President’s in a firm, all four individuals will have the same indication of being successful, \\nwhich suggests our operationaliza tion of successful leaders has really captured whether a group \\nof leaders or an entire company are successful, not one individual leader.  This observation leads \\ntwo conclusions.  First, if our data for one variab le is obtained from four individuals each in ten \\ncompanies and company level data is used for a nother variable, the sample number (n) is ten, not \\nforty.  (This sounds obvious but the author has found a similar mistak e in a paper accepted in the \\nJCEM .)  Second, we should probably r econsider using reported indica tors rather than archival \\nindicators or even to reconsider the le vels of analysis in our hypothesis.   \\n It should be noted that some researchers acknow ledge the difficulty of proving causality and \\nmerely hypothesize that two variables are associated in  some way.  It is this  author’s opinion that \\nsuch hypotheses are more technically appropriate but make a rather limited contribution to the \\nliterature.  Real contributions to our understa nding come from overcom ing both the statistical \\nand theoretical challenges that inevitab ly arise from compelling causal hypotheses. \\n \\n5.  Proper statistical an alysis is critical \\nThe example just discussed points at a fifth princi ple for conducting social science research:  the \\nneed to conduct proper statistic al analysis.  The author’s experience suggests that linear \\nregression is the construction rese arch statistical tool of choice  and that two mistakes involving \\nlinear regression are common.  One mi stake is that linear regression is often used when it is not \\nappropriate to do so.  The most common mistake is  to use regression even when the data violate \\nfundamental assumptions underlying regression:  1) dependent variable s are continuous and \\napproximate a normal distribution, 2) independent variables approximate a normal distribution or \\nare categorical, and 3) the relationships betwee n dependent and independ ent variables are linear \\nin nature.  Multiple regression textbooks suggest the need to perform various procedures before \\nand after performing multiple regression analysis to confirm that the underlying assumptions are not violated by the data or the model.  In addi tion, the independent variables should be analyzed \\nto confirm that collinearity is not excessive (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch, 1980). \\n Construction research data, especially those usin g Likert scales, are ofte n neither continuous nor \\nnormally distributed.

The second common error that some construction re searchers make is to perform only univariate \\nanalysis.  It was discussed unde r principle 4 that many relations hips between variables may be \\nstatistically significant but spurio us.  If two variables are found to  have statistically significant \\n(i.e., the chance of a Type I er ror being 5% or less) correl ation, we cannot be sure the \\nrelationship between them is spurio us unless we control for all possi ble antecedent variables, that \\nis, perform partial correlation analysis.  For our sample hypot hesis, we would need to analyze the \\npartial correlation between firms’ innovative scor e and financial performance while controlling \\nfor firm size and other possible antecedent variables.  The relatively easy way to eliminate plausible al ternative hypotheses is to perform multivariate \\nlinear regression using a model that  contains other potentially releva nt variables.  This way, one \\ngets a sense for how much each independent variab le in the model contributes to each dependent \\nvariable.  The results of the multiple regressi on analysis will also include how much of the \\noverall variance in the dependent  variables is explained by the independent variables.  Some \\nresearchers focus on the ρ values to identify relationships th at are statistically significant, but \\nignore the fact that the adjusted R squared (the square of the P earson product moment correlation \\ncoefficient adjusted for the degrees of freedom) of the model are so low that the models are \\nessentially meaningless.  An adjusted R squared above 0.25 is considered typically meaningful in \\nsocial science research.  \\n6.  Proper research design must be performed before data are collected \\nProper research design includes several distinct issu es, some of which are related to the previous \\nfive principles.  One key aspect is the sampling pl an, which consists of two decisions: the type of \\nsample and the size of the sample.  Regarding the t ype of sample, the scien tists in us know that \\ngood science typically involves random samples to  minimize the chance of bias within our \\nsample.  One problem with random samples is that  we will often be unable to obtain a reasonable \\nresponse rate, which is why convenience samples are so common in constr uction research (that \\nis, we ask firms that we feel are likely to ag ree to participate).  A nother problem with random \\nsamples is that we may not end up with enough firm s in a particular group that we would like to \\nmake conclusions about.  Stratified samples, in which we include specific numbers of firms from \\neach subgroup that we are interested in resear ching, are therefore common.  Ideally, the firms \\nwithin each subgroup are randomly selecte d, but this is not always possible. \\n Regarding the size of the sample, we know that the statistical power of  our analysis will be \\nhigher if our sample is as la rge as possible, yet we also know that large samples take \\nconsiderable time, effort and money.  An eas y mistake for researchers intending to perform \\nmultivariate analysis to make is focus only on the overall n required based on their number of \\nvariables in their multivariate model.  They fail to  realize it may be necessary to choose a sample \\nsize that will yield acceptable number of firm s in each variable grouping, that is, ensuring \\nsufficient cell counts to ensure  the model is stable.  This author spent hundreds of hours \\nsurveying over 100 firms about safety programs a nd performance, only to later find the desired \\nmultivariate analysis could not be perfo rmed due to insufficient cell counts!  \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For these re asons, it is suggested in \\nsome research methods textbooks that researcher s give misleading statements to subjects who \\nask about the research.

These principles are applicable to al l areas of construction re search that are aligned \\nwith social science rather than  with, for example, operations re search or information technology.  \\nFollowing these principles will he lp researchers reduce the threats to each of the four types of \\nvalidity identified in Cook and Campbell (1979) and increase the likelihood that their research \\nwill make a meaningful contribution to the literature.

This paper is only intended to serve as an \\nintroduction to effective research methods in c onstruction and to encourag e researchers to more \\nfully study the topic.  The author feels strongly  that graduate constr uction students performing \\nresearch on social science topics  should take at least one cour se on social science research \\nmethods and one course on multivariate statistical an alysis before initiating their research.  (The \\nauthor also believes such student s should also take at least one graduate course on organizational \\nbehavior.)  Including social sc ience research methods courses in a graduate curriculum in \\nconstruction management is unusual and likely cont roversial.  But such courses will be an \\nimportant step if the constructi on research community is to establish a reputation for effective \\nresearch in leadership and similar topics.

Several reports \\nsuggest remedial measures to arrest and revers e the trend. The common primary thread called for \\nin each report is the necessity for dramatic “cult ural” change to reduce adversarial conflicts and \\npromote collaboration through diffe rent team-working approaches. Impeding such change is the \\nIndustry’s reliance on contract s to instill trust and define  collaboration. However, “an \\norganization which depends solely upon its blueprints  for prescribed behavior is a fragile social \\nsystem” (Katz, 1964). Contrary to the call by many experts for more contractual requirements \\noutlining collaborative behavior, the key to successful collaborative construction projects is the willingness of the partic ipants to behave in a positive manner beyond contractual requirements. \\nThese extra-role behaviors, otherwise known as  Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) \\n(Bateman, Organ, 1983) or lack thereof, may be th e key attribute to a co llaborative culture in \\nconstruction project organiza tions. Many viewpoints of OCB,  including commitment to \\nsupervisors, careers, unions , and the organization itself continue to be researched. However, little \\nempirical research on multi-party project organi zational commitment exists. Therefore, the \\nprevailing conceptualizati on of commitment in organizations ma y be considerably less salient in \\nshort-lived construction project environments and therefore generating OCBs on construction \\nprojects may be more a function of commitment to  the social relationships of the participants \\nthan the contractual organization. \\nKey Words: Relational Contracting, Corporate Culture , Organizational Commitment, Project \\nDelivery, Collaboration, Organi zational Citizenship Behavior  \\nIntroduction \\nNumerous reports in the United States (CII,  1990, 1996), Australia (IS R, 1999), and Hong Kong \\n(CIRC, 2001) call for radical and dramatic “cult ural” change in the co nstruction industry and \\nrecommend fostering collaborati on through various team working a pproaches such as partnering, \\nproject alliancing, and relational co ntracting. A daunting task as change rarely comes easy on an \\nindividual basis let alone on a so cietal level comprising of ten, twenty, or even three thousand \\npeople on any given construction project.  \\nCulture is defined as the shared meanings, technology, language, norms, attitudes, beliefs, \\nbehaviors, and material objects of a society or group (Kanagy, Kr aybill, 1999).

Culture’s individual components however, are tangible. \\nFor example, numerous scientific and philosophica l discoveries such as the Earth being spherical \\nand Martin Luther’s 95 Theses significantly alte red medieval culture. With these discoveries, the \\nfirst to fall were commonly shar ed beliefs. The world was no l onger flat and every man had the \\nright to petition God personally. Subsequently, th is led to measurable changing attitudes, \\nbehaviors, and norms. New technologies such as the printing press were developed and science \\nwas no longer considered the work of the Devil.  Today, these distinct cultures are defined as \\n“The Dark Ages” and “The Enlightenment”. Neither  can be easily defined or measured, but since \\ntheir attributes are definable,  the resultant culture is desc ribable through these attributes. \\nAlthough the time periods of the Dark Ages and the Enlightenment appear to happen at two \\ndifferent distinct periods of time, the transition took hundreds of years. Hist ory is littered with \\nfailed social programs that attempt to effect cu ltural change in too short a time, often with \\ncatastrophic results. The Chines e Cultural Revolution (1966 – 1976), which resulted in chaos, \\nnumerous deaths and millions of injuries and imprisonments, attests to this condition.  Cultural \\nchange takes time and requires battle after battle; defeat after defeat until a decisive moment of proof (i.e. Columbus’s return from the “Indies” proved that the world was indeed round) causes a \\nsea change of belief.   \\nHong Kong based studies on joint risk manage ment through relational contracting (RC) and \\nactual project alliancing efforts in Australia are two examples that reflect  a growing desire for \\nchange within the construction i ndustry itself.  The reason for this trend is attributable to many \\nfactors, but it is primarily due to the continued de structive effects that th e industry’s historically \\nadversarial and selfish nature ha s on quality, customer satisfacti on, profitability, and professional \\nrelationships (Rahman, Kumaraswamy, 2004). Perh aps the changing attitudes and desire for \\nchange may be a necessity for survival. Althoug h the recent efforts in Australia and Hong Kong \\nmay not have the historical si gnificance that Christopher Columbus  or Martin Lu ther has, the \\nConstruction Industry may be on  the cusp of a similar renaissance namely, the birth of \\ncollaboration. \\n \\nThe Construction Social System \\nIn addition to culture as define d by Kanagy and Kraybill, any soci ety’s social system is also \\ncomprised of architecture and ritual. Social arch itecture describes how a so ciety is organized and \\nhow it fits together. Ritual is orderly, repetiti ve, and meaningful social  interaction amongst the \\nsociety providing harmonious interplay betw een culture and architecture ensuring each \\nreciprocates the expected returns (Kanagy, Kr aybill, 1999). Recent efforts to change the \\narchitecture from the traditional construction pr oject delivery systems (i.e. Design-Bid-Build, \\nDesign-Build, and CM at Risk) are currently  being employed (Hauck, 2004). These changes \\ninclude structurally aligning the participants to ward a more project oriented focus verses an \\nindividual focus.  This new focus has participan ts share risks and rewards.  These changes are a \\nstep in the collaborative direction by chan ging one of the social system components - \\narchitecture. These changes implicitly structure the relationship in a covenant-based format \\nholding the project as the central  focus. Meanwhile, the project participants’ success and/or \\nfailure are inextricably linked to the success of the project.  However, despite the structural \\nchanges, it is evident that firmly held beliefs an d perhaps habits continue to generate the same ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This reality spawned \\nadditional studies declaring that a cultural ch ange in construction is required (Rahman, \\nKumaraswamy, 2004). Undoubtedly, the industry could benefit from a cultural change.  Equally \\nimportant though, is to consider ritual as it prov ides harmony between ar chitecture and culture \\nwithout which the social system breaks down. \\nTrust and Culture \\nRoutinely, studies have shown that  the primary ingredient that fosters collaborative cultures is \\ntrust but trust is difficult to achieve. Rational be havior for human beings is behaving in such a \\nway that maximizes one’s self-interest while redu cing potential costs or pa ins (see, for example, \\nCollins, 1982). The second part of the definition for rational behavior does not bode well for the \\nestablishment of trust. The best way to reduce pot ential costs or pains is not to trust the other \\nperson. A common exercise perfor med in many trust building lessons is for a person to hold his \\narms in front of him and begin to fall backward trusting that another person will catch him before \\nhitting the ground, which obviously woul d entail great pain. The best way to ensure that costs or \\npains are reduced in this situation is to not fall to begin with. Therefore, it can be surmised that \\ntrust and collaboration is inherently irrational.  \\nToo often researchers and practitioners act as if trust is rational and attempt to instill trust \\nthrough the vehicle of a contract. For example, Flora states “behav ior of the project  participants \\nmust be clearly specified when approaching c onstruction with a more collaborative project \\ndelivery system” (Flora 1998). Kanter  further asserts that “the cont ract must iden tify how project \\nparticipants will behave in the pursuit of a common goal” (Kanter 1994). These are commonly \\nheld beliefs that many experts ad here to as a requirement to fo ster collaborative  construction \\nprojects. In each of the former theses, the fo cus is on defining appropriate behavior and its \\nenforcement through contracts or some other lega l document as a vehicle to establish trust. \\nHowever, this approach reverses the causal orde r of the variables. Co ntracts do not have the \\nability to establish trust. Contr acts are based on established trust.  Underlying all contracts is an \\nunstated established level of trust that the other party will meet their re sponsibilities and “catch \\nthe person falling backwards.” Wors e yet, attempting to instill tr ust through a contract heightens \\nthe expectation that one party wi ll not fulfill their responsibilities let alone act collaboratively \\noutside contractual requirements. Therefore, many prescribe that more “contract” is required to \\nspell out what is and what is not collaborative, again making the condition more and more distrustful ultimately spiraling down to an inability to collaborate. \\nWhile laying the groundwork for research on or ganizational behavior, Ka tz states that “an \\norganization which depends solely upon its blueprints  for prescribed behavior is a fragile social \\nsystem” (Katz, 1964). In an effort  to protect individual’s rights by de fining roles, responsibilities, \\nand behavior, contracts inherently divide the pr oject participants from each other and encourage \\nindividuals to look out for indi vidual self-interest (Clegg, 1992). Contracts provide rather \\nprescriptive formulas that disrup t collaborative relationships.  In lieu of being inspired to work \\ncollaboratively, fear of the c onsequences of breaki ng the contract then becomes the only \\nmotivating factor for collabora tion. Fear may generate obedi ence, but it rarely generates \\ncollaboration.  Therein lays the problem with us ing contracts to insti ll trust. Focusing on the \\ncontract to generate collaborative behavior inherently retards a cultu re of trust. The social system \\nthen becomes dysfunctional as th e architecture is designed ar ound collaborative intent, but the ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Although the new collaborative \\narchitectures may yield some operational benefits, the culture of fear and distrust remains and \\ncollaboration is therefore not fully realized. \\nTrust or lack thereof is minimally dependent upon the completeness of the contract or the quality \\nof the construction drawings. Rather , trust is a dependant variable that stems from some sort of \\nrelational construct. Once trust or  distrust is established, the characteristics of culture are \\ndeveloped and the culture of a given society begins  to take shape. The established level of trust \\nplays a significant role in the at titudes, beliefs, and behaviors of  the players involved leading to \\nthe type of culture expected. It is at this point  beyond contractual obligations that tests the metal \\nof collaborative culture and establishe s the point where this study begins. \\nOrganizational Commitment \\nCommitment in organizations has generated a great  deal of interest in organizational behavior \\ncircles over the past several decades. Researcher s have identified organizational commitment as \\nan antecedent of any number of work-related variables including absenteeism, performance, \\nturnover, and altruistic behavior. However, most  of the research is unclear as to whether \\ncommitment is behavioral or attitudinal. O’Re ily and Chatman (1986:492) s uggest that “the lack \\nof consensus in previous research can be attributed  in part, to a failure to  differentiate carefully \\namong the antecedents and consequences of co mmitment on the one hand, and the basis of \\nattachment on the other.” They maintain that co mmitment is best defined as the basis of an \\nindividual’s psychological attachment to the organi zation.” This basis of attachment is distinct \\nfrom either the antecedents of commitment or from its consequences. In keeping with this concept, Meyer and Allen (1991) distinguished between three separate types of commitment. \\nSpecifically, these types are affective commit ment, continuance commitment, and normative \\ncommitment. Following are th e descriptions of each: \\nAffective commitment refers to the employee’s emotional attachment to, identification with, and \\ninvolvement in the organization. Employees with a strong affective commitment continue \\nemployment with the organization because they want  to do so. Continuance commitment refers to \\nan awareness of the costs associated with leavin g the organization. Employees whose primary link \\nto the organization is based on continuance commitment remain because they need  to do so. \\nFinally, normative commitment refl ects a feeling of obligation to continue employment. Employees \\nwith a high level of normative commitment feel that they ought  to remain with the organization.

Dealing within the contractual \\nboundaries falls into the “needs”  or “ought to” category wher eas, collaborating outside the \\ncontract falls into the “want to” category. U nderstanding a project pa rticipant’s emotional \\nattachment to, identification with, and involvement  in the project organi zation will conceivably \\nhelp to predict one’s willingness to collaborate. Unfortunately, research in this area generally focuses on commitment in organizations from the viewpoint of commitment to supervisors, \\ncareers, unions, and the organization itself. Little to no empirical research exists that examines \\ncommitment in multi-party project organizations . Presumably, the prevailing conceptualization \\nof commitment in organizations may be consid erably less salient in short-lived construction \\nproject environments and therefore project orga nizational commitment is  more likely to be a \\nfunction of the extra-role behaviors described by Katz. \\nOrganizational Citizenship Behavior \\nTwo decades following Katz’s recognition of th e significance of extra-role behaviors to \\norganizational success, Bateman and Organ pr oduced the seminal piece on Organizational \\nCitizenship Behavior (OCB). OCB is defined as “individual behavi or that is discretionary, not \\ndirectly or explicitly re cognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes \\nthe effective functioning of the organization”  (Bateman & Organ, 1983). Citizenship behaviors \\nare classified into six cate gories: sportsmanship, organizat ional loyalty, organizational \\ncompliance, individual initiative, civic vi rtue, and helping beha vior (Podsakoff, 2000).  Each \\ncategory correlates with each of the three type s of commitment. Helping behavior, otherwise \\ntermed as organizational citizensh ip behavior directed toward other individuals (OCBI), has a \\nmoderate correlation to affectiv e commitment and provides a spri ngboard from which to analyze \\nproject organizational co mmitment (Bolon, 1993).  \\nOCBI is important in several ways, includi ng enhancing individual and group productivity, \\nfreeing up resources, increasing coor dination, and aiding in the main tenance of a favorable work \\nclimate (Podsakoff, Mackenzie, Pain, Bachrach , 2000). The value of OCBI in contributing to \\nindividual, group, and organizatio nal performance has prompted much research concerning the \\nantecedents and consequences of OCBI. These ant ecedents are generally classified into one of \\nfour categories: employee characteristics, task characteristics, leadership behaviors, and \\norganizational characteristics (P odsakoff et al., 2000). Justific ation for these relationships \\nbetween these variables and citizenship behavior  are generally based upon the existence of a \\nsocial exchange relationship between the employee and the orga nization. According to social \\nexchange theory, employees are likely to provide effort and perform beyond their prescribed role \\ndefinition if they feel that the organization is  providing them with positive work experiences \\n(Blau, 1986). This positive relati onship between employer and empl oyee promotes a relationship \\nof trust and reciprocity. Based on the established trust and a desi re for reciprocity, the employee \\nis then willing and motivated to provide extr a effort and performa nce through citizenship \\nbehaviors. \\nOf the various element of OCB, only OCBI is directed at fellow empl oyees (Podsakoff et.al., \\n2000).  The other elements of OCB do not require a second party and are th erefore less likely to \\nbe affected by interpersonal re lationships.  For example, an employee choosing to be more \\nconscientious in his or her work habits (an elem ent of citizenship) likely does so because of an ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The construction project environment doe s not lend itself to an exchange relationship \\nwith the organization and is not fitt ing for this application.  It doe s, however, lend itself to social \\nexchange analysis between the players.  Although OCBI has a moderate relationship to \\norganizational commitment and job satisfaction, other variables may be at work.  An employee \\nmight be involved in a social exch ange relationship that results in OCBI for his or her colleagues \\neven if the employee does not have a positive social exchange relationship with the organization.  Regardless of one’s level of satisfaction wi th or commitment to the organization, strong \\ninterpersonal relationships among employees will likely result in hi gh levels of OCBI.  OCBI is \\nthe act of providing help to another employee, no t necessarily the organization.  Therefore, the \\ninterpersonal exchange involved in helping a fe llow employee would have  different antecedents \\nunrelated to the exchange relationship between th e employee and the organization.  This scenario \\nhas profound implications for construction project participants if it could be shown that strong \\ninterpersonal relationships between project participants would result in OCBIs. \\nThe Research Question \\nSocial Exchange Theory provides a theoretica l framework for the intended research. Social \\nExchange theory purports that the most fundamen tal form of social interaction is a mutual \\nexchange of benefits or favor s, which can include not only material benefits but also \\npsychological benefits such as expressions of approval, respect, esteem , and affection (Yukl, \\n1998).  \\nPurportedly, OCB theories present processes and guidelines that fulfill the “ritual” requirement \\nof a social system.  Existing OCB research co nsiders citizenship behaviors within monolithic \\norganizations, however, in construction the multi-par ty project organization is the primary arbiter \\nof organizational success and existing research offers limited emphasis on such multi-organization project organizations . Therefore, the research question is “Do the attitudes, \\nbehaviors, and sentiments found within OCBI provi de the necessary ritual impetus to establish a \\ncollaborative culture in multi-party construction project organizations?”  \\nAppropriate dependant variable s to be considered include OCBI performance and receipt \\nspecifically, who receives OCBI s and why. Additionally, what impact do OCBIs have on \\ncollaborative culture? Independe nt variables may include, but not necessarily be limited to, \\nprevious experience between players, assymetrical  relationships, third-party influence, affective \\ncommitment, organic solidarity among players, in terpersonal similarities among participants, and \\nthe structural networks that link individual partic ipants and their participating organizations (see \\nvan de Bunt et al, 2005).  \\n \\nReferences \\nBateman, T.S., & Organ, D.W.

While numerous asset development processes exist to \\ntrack project progress during diffe rent phases, none examine the financial and operational impact \\nof an entire portfolio of projects at any one point in time.  Consequently, this paper presents the \\nconcept of program renewal as one remedy to these limitations.  Through program renewal, a portfolio may be expanded or contracted de pending upon the performa nce of the individual \\nprojects contained therein.  Be sides providing an integrating mechanism for planning, budgeting, \\nand strategy, program renewal improves commun ication between business leaders and project \\nmanagers – creating confidence that A) projects  are being built right and, B) that the right \\nprojects are being built.    \\nBackground \\n \\nThe ultimate result of the management practices of an owner’s organization is performance – \\nmarket performance, operational performance and financial performance.  However, after implementing numerous operational and management  practices that were reputed to lead to \\nimproved project performance, many architec ture, engineering, and construction (A/E/C) \\nindustry clients have experienced mixed results at an aggregate level when all projects are \\nconsidered.  This situation ma y arise from both cultural and st ructural disconnects in project \\nexecution.  Indeed, today’s project management explicitly understands and uses techniques that, in some cases, may help one project succeed at the expense of another (Fricke & Shenhar 2000).  This problem is often compounded by functional cor porate structures and pr ocesses at odds with \\nflexible project-based forms of organization.  Thus, many A/E/C owner fi rms’ financial project \\nperformance results follow a ‘whale curve’ of  cumulative profitability  (Cooper & Kaplan 1999) \\nas can be seen in Figure 1.  Data for this pl ot were obtained from the 2002 project performance \\nresults of a Fortune 500 commercial building pr ogram owner, illustrating that 235% of the \\ncompany’s earnings before income tax (EBIT) we re generated by 41% of their projects (Mulva \\n2004).  In other words, 59% of this firm’s pr ojects generated either no profit or a loss on a \\nrecurring, annual basis (i.e., taken 18 months after ‘grand opening’). \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The ‘Whale Curve’ of Cumulative Profitability. \\n \\nAs a result, the need for effective techniques for what is commonly called multi-project, \\nportfolio, or program management has become clear er.  Program management is needed to avoid \\nthe type of ‘value subtraction’ depicted in Figur e 1 (i.e., when one projec t depletes the benefits \\nof another).  Plus, because up to 90%, by value,  of all A/E/C industry projects occur in a multi-\\nproject context (Turner 1993), owne rs’ strategic procedures such as the capital budgeting process \\nmust be modified to reflect the project environm ent(s) faced by each individual firm.  This paper \\ndoes this by demonstrating that quantitative benefits  have been achieved by A/E/C owners \\npracticing program management within a corporate process of program renewal. \\n \\nThe Traditional Capital Budgeting Process \\n \\nFor the most part, companies consider thei r operations and planning processes to be \\ndecentralized because the actual plans of the orga nization – the initiatives, milestones, schedules, \\nresource allocations, etc. – do not exist at th e executive level where financial goals have \\ntraditionally enjoyed top billing (Federal 1997).  As  a result, vast differences often exist within \\nA/E/C organizations regarding the organiza tion’s business strategy, long-term planning \\nobjectives, and day-to-day operational needs.  Mo reover, the goals of project management, the \\nexecutive suite and the customer are different and are generally not ta ken into account by the \\ntraditional capital budgeting process (ibid.).  Taken together, this situation leaves A/E/C owners \\nparticularly vulnerable to a ‘cyc le of decay’ resulting from the use of financial measures (e.g., \\nnet present value (NPV) and internal rate of retu rn (IRR) analysis) instead of control data for \\ndecision making regarding their selec tion of projects.  This ‘cycle’ manifests itself in these ways: \\n \\n1. Approval is given for projects in year n which meet financial criteria and whose \\ncumulative value is below a pred etermined budgetary constraint. \\n2. As long as these projects progress satisfact orily as determined by asset development \\nprocesses (ADP’s), funding continues into year n+1. \\n3. In year n+1, another portfolio of projects is appr oved using a different budget that is \\ninadvertently constrained by the set of year n projects. \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This rea llocation might occur if  the slate of year n+1 projects \\nfit into corporate strategy better or if they possessed better financial metrics.  Effectively, this means that if select year n projects were eliminated or modified in year n+1, a different portfolio \\nof year n+1 projects would result.  Consequently, tr aditional capital budgeting practices have the \\npotential to obtain suboptimal results when pr ojects extend across multiple years.  Thus, an \\nimproved portfolio selection and management process is needed.  \\nThe Role of Program Management \\n \\nProgram Management is not about executing project s, but rather about creating benefits.  At a \\nfundamental level, a program is a group of pr ojects that are manage d and controlled in a \\ncoordinated way to achieve a set of business ob jectives that would not be possible were the \\nprojects to be managed independently (CCTA 1993).  Consequently, program management is \\nconcerned with the coordinated support, planning, prioritization and monitoring of projects to \\nmeet changing business needs.  It is an owne r’s ‘bridge’ between project execution and fiscal \\nreward.  The added value it creates depends on the appropriate alloca tion of resources to \\nindividual projects via tailored processes.  Th is requires effective a nd dedicated leadership. \\n Programs create value by improving upon the manage ment of projects in isolation, especially \\nwhere the working environment is made up of num erous interrelated projects and where project \\nintegration – in terms of both development and deliverables – is crucial to competitive success \\n(Pellegrinelli 1997).  Thus, the benefits of implementing programs include (ibid.): \\n \\n• Greater visibility of project s amongst executive management \\n• Better prioritization of projects \\n• More efficient and appropriate use of resources \\n• Projects driven by busin ess strategy and needs \\n• Better planning and coordination  \\n• Explicit recognition and understand ing of project dependencies  \\n \\nWhile these advantages are not guaranteed, the application of program management can make \\nthe most of resources (i.e., personnel, money, a nd time) and effort expended on projects, and can \\nsustain the drive to maximize the benefits to the business.  However, it is important to remember \\nthat successful benefit delivery need not de pend on successful projects.  A poorly managed \\nproject might still deliver benefits  due to changes in the client’s business environment.  In fact, \\nbenefits are typically obtained when combined with the outcome of other projects.  Therefore, \\nwithin a program, it is helpful to classify projects in terms of their ability to deliver benefits.  Reiss (1996) has identified f our project classifications: \\n \\n• Direct projects: projects with direct benefits \\n• Enabling projects: projects that  deliver no direct benefit but are vital to the delivery of \\na whole range of benefits from other projects \\n• Passenger projects: projects that  can only add to benefits ex pected from other projects \\n• Synergistic projects: a group of projects, each of which makes no (or only a small) \\ncontribution, unless combined into a program ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This phenomenon is co mmonly known as ‘benefits creep’ (ibid.).  To \\nsteer clear of benefits creep, pr ogram management requires that individual projects be dropped or \\nmodified and new projects be introduced in order to maximize benefits.  Unfortunately, few \\nA/E/C owner firms formally define their work wi thin a program management context due to the \\noverriding and incorrect belief amon gst project managers that a program is merely a complex \\nproject (Mulva & Vanegas 2002).  As a resu lt, a new method for implementing program \\nmanagement within an owner’s organization is required. \\n \\nImplementing Program Management \\n \\nBeyond project management, program management  places more emphasis on being a business \\ntool and strategic aid, thereby allowing the horizon for business pl anning to go beyond one year \\nto create longer-term plans.

Similarly, risk \\nmitigation and change management may be managed at the program level, possibly enhancing a firm’s competitive position thr ough execution economies of scale an d/or economies of repetition.  \\nNotably, program management can essentially be come the ‘heart’ of an owner firm, bypassing \\neven ‘leading edge’ asset development pro cesses (ADP’s) and benchmarking database \\nassessments used to link planning with project outcomes.  Indeed, it is not enough for executive \\nmanagement to ask project staffs “Are we doing th e project right?” They must also ask “Are we \\ndoing the right project?”   \\n \\nA New Business Process: Program Renewal  \\nSince projects result in deliverables and deliverables result in benefits, the introduction of an \\nimproved project selection process is needed.  Such a process would provide a ‘top-down’ \\napproach to the management of benefits in a pr ogram management environment.  In the context \\nof deciding whether an owner firm  can cope with another projec t, a formal project selection \\nprocess that parallels capital budge ting processes would help execu tives consider the impact of \\nadditional project(s) on the existing portfolio.  As a result, it is imperative that owner companies \\nhave the flexibility in their processes to stop project s so that others can be carried out.  This is \\nnot a trivial matter because, at present, few owne rs have the processes ne cessary to alleviate the \\nimpact of legacy projects (i.e., projects funded in prior years) upon projects under consideration \\nin capital budgeting.  Fortunatel y, one process possessing the flexib ility to halt sp ecific projects \\nis program renewal.  There are many possible developmental paths to c onsider for a program.  In fact, one of the \\nfundamental differences between programs and proj ects is the pattern of  activities over time.  \\nUnlike projects, programs do not necessarily have a single, clearly-defined deliverable, or even a \\nfinite time horizon.  Instead, they are part of a continuum (Pellegrinelli 1997) as depicted in \\nFigure 3. \\nInitiation Dissolution\\nDeliveryRenewal\\nPlanningDeliveryRenewal\\nPlanningDeliveryRenewal\\nPlanningInitiation Dissolution\\nDeliveryRenewal\\nPlanningDeliveryRenewal\\nPlanningDeliveryRenewal\\nPlanning\\n \\n \\nFigure 3.

Ne xt, the program must be defined and planned in \\ndetail.  This includes the development of program objectives and the allocation of responsibilities \\nthroughout an owner’s organization.  Notably, programmatic planning follows either initiation or \\nrenewal, thereby forming the continuum itself.  When modified, this pl anning step becomes the \\nbasis for a new class of asset developmen t process, one based on a dynamic form of \\nbenchmarking.  Once a program is planned, it enters the delivery phase of the continuum illustrated in Figure 3.  \\nIn this phase, project perform ance is controlled closely and pr ogram benefits are continually \\nevaluated.  Where the potential for benefits subtr action exists, projects in  the delivery phase are \\nmodified and new program requirements are id entified.  Once benefits are confirmed as \\noriginally conceived, the program  is renewed if its continuing business requirements can be \\njustified; otherwise it is dissolved.  However, the program may also be renewed with a new sense \\nof strategic direction or focus.   Such program renewal may accompany changes to an owner’s \\nbusiness model.  Finally, in the case where greate r benefits can result fr om a different program, \\nan existing program will be dissolved and its projects and personnel reassigned.  Undeniably, these forms of renewal underscore the need for periodic adjustment to a firm’s portfolio of \\nprojects.  One way to accomplish this is to make program renewal a process which parallels an owner firm’s annual budgeting cycle.   \\nStudy and Findings  \\n \\nTo quantify the benefit of program management paired with program renewal, accounting data \\nwere collected by the author in 2001 and 2002 fr om 167 commercial building projects developed \\nbetween 1996 and 2000 by three different large building program owners (Mulva 2004).  \\nSpecifically, these projects were developed with in seven programs and were analyzed regarding \\nthe percentage of projects cancelle d.

Fortunately, it may be po ssible to benefit from properly implementing \\nprogram management.  Doing so calls for a more active role of owner ex ecutives in developing a \\nportfolio of projects through an implementation strategy and the process of program renewal.  \\nYet, this demands leadership.  Given this cont ext, programs may act as the ‘bridge’ between \\nstrategy and project development, thereby increas ing the prospects for improved performance as \\npresented here.  This is important because th ese findings justify the combined practices of \\nprogram management and program renewal as both  new and not normally performed.  In fact, \\nthe author is only aware of a dozen owner firm s in the U.S. construction industry which employ \\nboth practices simultaneously.  The path of program renewal has already met overwhelming success in the automotive industry.  \\nIn particular, that industry’s pr actice of developing programs as  common platforms for a variety \\nof new vehicles as diverse as a sedan, a convert ible, and a sport-utility vehicle is routine.  \\nMoreover, each platform is sanctioned, manage d, and renewed on a periodic basis (Nobeoka & \\nCusumano 1995).

High \\nperformance “green” or “sustainab le” buildings have emerged as an answer to growing concern \\nfor the environment, offering the advantages of minimized ecological impact and improved \\noccupant health, as well as reduced operating cost s for owners. In an effort to incorporate an \\nenvironmental consciousness in engineering educa tion, the American Indian  Housing Initiative, a \\nthree part course series and research program at The Pennsylvania State University, integrates \\nsustainable techniques in both bu ilding design and construction proc esses. Experiential learning \\nthrough an annual design-build project afford s students the opportunity to develop the \\nknowledge, skills, and attitudes n ecessary to achieve environmenta l consciousness in both their \\nprofessional and personal lives. The practical asp ect of the course, during which students erect a \\nbuilding in Montana, also serves  to provide a valuable service to the collaborating Northern \\nCheyenne Tribe. This paper presents the lessons learned in the areas of integrated design and construction education, as well as the proposed pot ential of public scholarship as a strategy for \\nintegrating sustainability in engineering education. \\nKey Words:   Green Building, Sustainable, Construction, Education \\nIntroduction \\nProducing 30% of green house gases, consuming 36% of energy produced and 12% of potable \\nwater, and contributing to 30% of the waste stream added to land fills each year, buildings represent major consumers of energy and natura l resources in the United States (USGBC, 2002). \\nUnfortunately, the pursuit of sust ainability in construction remains the exception rather than the \\nnorm. Antiquated methods of delivering buildings mu st be replaced by tec hniques that facilitate \\nenvironmentally conscious decision-making and th e disciplines of buildi ng design, construction, \\nand operations must adopt integrated perspectives  and engage in a comprehensive evaluation of \\nbuilding design and delivery. This paper describes an effort at The Pennsylvania State Universi ty to explore the design and \\nconstruction of green buildings through an integr ated applied research and education program. \\nCurrently in its 6\\nth year, the American Indian Housing Initiative (AIHI) pr ovides opportunities \\nfor practitioners and students to explore sustai nable building techniques a nd apply their research \\nin actual building projects.  As part of the seri es, students research sustainability during spring \\nsemester classes, journey to Montana during the summer to participate in building construction, \\nand then return in the Fall to evaluate an d document their experiences.

Partnering classroom \\nlearning and laboratory re search, student participants constr uct structures during summer “blitz \\nbuilds”. The utilization of state- of-the-art analysis tools for virtual prototyping and building \\nperformance modeling facilitate a fluid transition from classroom design to on-site construction. \\nThe summer blitz build also emphasizes distri buted teamwork and student leadership while \\napplying lean production principles  to streamline production on site.  \\nA Learning Model For Sustainable Construction \\nModels of environmental education have existed for decades and include a broad set of learning \\ngoals that constitute the parameters of sustainable design-build pedagogy.  These attributes are characterized in the Tbilisi Decl aration, created as a result of a UNESCO and the United Nations \\nEnvironmental Program (UNEP) conferen ce in 1977 (The Stockholm Declaration, 1972, \\nBelgrade Charter,1975, and Tbilisi Declaratio n, 1977). According to the declaration, the \\nobjectives of environmental education are to develop students who possess: awareness and \\nsensitivity; knowledge, experience and understanding; attitudes, values and feelings of concern \\nfor the environment and motivation to take action; skills for identifying and solving environmental issues; participa tion opportunity in resolving e nvironmental problems. In 1992, \\nthe United Nations produced Agenda 21 that intended to direct society towards increased \\nsustainability (Agenda 21, 1992, Cortese 1997). Agenda  21 called for integrated decision-making \\nby individuals, organizations, in stitutions, businesses and governments in order to incorporate \\nenvironmental considerations and goals into social, economic, and e nvironmental decisions \\n(Calder and Clugston 2003). In 1997, the US Pr esident’s Council on Su stainable Development \\ndefined the role of education for sustainabi lity as: “strong core academics, understanding the \\nrelationships between disciplines, systems thi nking, lifelong learning, hands-on experiential \\nlearning, community-based learning , technology, partnerships, family involvement, and personal \\nresponsibility” (PLDE, 1997). Common theme among these initia tives is the importance of \\ndeveloping a broad collection of educational meas ures that serve to mold learning objectives, \\nwhich include: (1) knowledge  and awareness of sustainable practices  and technologies, (2) skill \\nsets that permit action to be taken to support environmental causes, and (3) attitudes  that will \\ncontinue to influence students’ decisions in  both their personal and professional lives.  \\n Service learning models, such as those employed by Engineering Projects in Community Service  \\n(EPICS) founded at Purdue University, offer studen ts an opportunity to l earn in an applied and \\nhands-on setting and facilitate the acquireme nt of the knowledge and skills required in \\nprofessional fields.  An increased awareness of  the role of engineer s and the well-being of \\ncommunities is also demonstrated by the emerging program entitled Engineers without Borders  \\nfounded by Bernard Amadei at the University of  Colorado. Public Scholarship is a pedagogical \\nmodel that unites these concepts. A subculture of  service learning, Public  Scholarship examines \\nthe reciprocal engagement between universit y and community partners rather than the \\nunidirectional flow of knowledge and skills from  service provider to service receiver. Through \\nthe application of the knowledge and skills of  both academic and community-based partners, \\nPublic Scholarship integrates teac hing, research, and service in a way that validates  and enhances \\nthe knowledge base of those both insi de and outside of the university.

The \\nAmerican Indian Housing Initiati ve (AIHI) is a collaborative effort between several research \\ninstitutions and Chief Dull Knife College on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation that aims to \\nhelp meet the need for housing in Native Am erican Communities. The Pennsylvania State \\nUniversity serves as the lead institution of AI HI, housing an integrated research and education \\nprogram on sustainable building methods.  Courses and graduate research focused on sustainable \\ntechnologies and practices utili ze AIHI as a mechanism for hands -on and applied experiences in \\nthe planning, design, cons truction, and operation  of green building proj ects. The Chief Dull \\nKnife College and the Northern Cheyenne Community being the future users of the green buildings, directly contribute to  the design and construction phase s of the building processes by \\nattending the design charettes, providing input and feedback dur ing design, and helping construct \\nthe facilities.  Partners at the University of Wisc onsin and the University of Texas at Austin also \\ncontribute in conducting the design  and on-site leadership of AIHI  projects. The program serves \\nas a mechanism to realize public scholarship  at The Pennsylvania State University. The \\nfollowing objectives are pursued through graduate re search and through a three-part course series \\noffered to undergraduates from diverse academic  backgrounds:  (1) Introduce students to the \\nfundamental concepts of sustainable building design and construction, including those methods \\nof inquiry required when working with new a nd unproven material technologies, (2) Build \\ncollaboration and leadership sk ills through participa tion in interdisciplinary teams that are \\nresponsible for defines outcomes on a real build ing project, and (3) Immerse students in a \\ndistinct culture in which sustai nable technologies can be applied to make a visible improvement \\nto the living conditions in an  American Indian community. \\nCore Sustainable Technology: Strawbale Construction \\nAIHI projects strive to incor porate regionally appropriate, sustai nable technologies, with locally \\navailable materials, environmentally friendly pa ints and finishes, wast e-reducing prefabrication \\nand panelization, and the reuse or recycling of materials.  The technology that serves as the \\nfulcrum of all AIHI projects, however, is strawb ale construction. An altern ative to the standard \\nwood, concrete, and steel construction methods ta ught to architecture and engineering students, \\nstrawbale construction offers an excellent medium  for students to explore an alternative building \\nmaterial. To this end, the AIHI course series pr ovide students with the ch ance to experiment with \\nstrawbale construction in the laboratory, partic ipate in design and cons truction of strawbale \\nstructures, and assess the performa nce of completed strawbale proj ects. The process of strawbale \\nconstruction and plaster finish is  also engaging, and facilitates volunteer partic ipation in the \\nconstruction process.  Although the mechanical pr operties of strawbale c onstruction are not fully \\nunderstood, the limited strategi c testing completed thus far has demonstrated the viable \\nproperties of strawbale constr uction as a mainstream buildin g material (King, 2002, Kocak, 2003 \\nand Premchandran, 2004). \\nTeaching Sustainable De sign and Construction \\nThe AIHI course series has evolved from an in itial attempt to provide hands-on and meaningful \\nexperiences for students to an integrated educ ational program on sustai nable building methods.  \\nWhile the course includes a broad array of ex periences and objectives, each contribute to the \\nunifying theme of education in sustainability, and help to develop th e knowledge, skills, and \\nattitudes that foster environmental decision-maki ng.

Each of these structures is currently in use and occupied by tribal members on the Crow, Lakota, and Northern  Cheyenne reservations.  In the summer of \\n2006, AIHI team members will complete a 4800 SF, LEED certified day care and early childhood \\ndevelopment center.  Initially supported by pr ivate donations, all current AIHI projects are \\nfunded through federal housing and rural assistance programs at the Department of Housing and \\nUrban Development and the U.S. Department  of Agriculture.  Through collaborative \\npartnerships with tribes, AIHI has help ed to raise over $1,150,000 in  direct support for \\nconstruction projects on the Northe rn Cheyenne Reservati on.  All educational expenses related to \\nAIHI are currently covered by student fees, s ponsors, and grants from the National Science \\nFoundation.   In addition to the physical spaces made possi ble by AIHI, new knowledge has been generated \\nthrough the graduate work associated with the program. This knowledge both informs and \\nsupplements the basic research conducted by unde rgraduates in the AIHI course series. Five \\nMasters Thesis projects have been devoted to the development of a long-term sustainable \\nhousing and economic development program on the Northern Cheyenne Re servation including a \\nself-determined housing program for the Northe rn Cheyenne Tribal Housing Authority, a \\nsustainable design process model fo r the Northern Cheyenne, lateral load testing of straw walls, \\nenergy modeling strategies for strawbale walls, and most recently, an assessment of the AIHI \\ncourse series as a model for in corporating sustainability in e ngineering education through public \\nscholarship.

These mechanisms included entry-exit \\nsurveys for students, content anal ysis of student discussions, reflective essay assignments for \\nindividual students, on-site in terviews, and focus group discus sions.  The results of these \\nassessment tools were then used to refine th e course series and to  develop more concise \\nassessment techniques for future offerings of  the course. The core class activity found to \\ninfluence student’s knowledge of sustainable practices  was the integrated and hands-on \\nexperience with an alternative build ing material.  In addition, student s cite the chance to actually \\nimprove the environmental aspect s of an AIHI project through re search as an important and \\nmotivating feature of the course series.  Students completing the course series have elevated \\ninterests in sustainable practices ; however, few can fully articu late a well-rounded position on \\nsustainability. This is understandable due to th e conflicting and debatable issues that embroil \\nenvironmental issues. It is more reasonable to  expect students to gain an awareness of \\nsustainable practices and an intere st to pursue further lessons in the future that will shape their \\nindividual perspectives about building a nd the environment. The development of attitudes that \\nwill lead to more environmentally conscious behavior has been by far the most challenging outcomes of the course series to assess.  Initial indica tors surfaced as students cited the course \\nexperience as the motivation to pursue a job with an environmentally conscious design or \\nconstruction firm.  Some students indicated that they had begun to alter their personal energy and \\nwater use as a result of the cour se.  Early assessment results are currently being used to develop \\nentry and exit surveys for student s that do a thorough job of asse ssing the incoming and exiting \\nattitudes of students, and the key elements of  the course that result in attitude shifts. \\n The skill sets of interd isciplinary collaboration and leadership that the course series strives to \\ndevelop are challenging for students to master in just one course.  The course does successfully \\nexpose students to leadership positions in wh ich they have the chance to plan, succeed, and \\nsometimes fail as teams in the deployment of su stainable practices in the field.  The vital \\ncomponent of this experience is the feedback that  they receive regardless of the outcome, and has \\nresulted in the development of new peer assessme nt and alternative feedback mechanisms in the \\ncourse. Another key lesson learned has been the contribution of the Northern Cheyenne in the \\nlearning experience of the students and the ability  to demonstrate the impact of a sustainable \\ntechnology in a community in nee d.  Possessing inherent principles that place  great value the on \\nenvironment, the Northern Cheyenne, like most American Indian tribes, set a powerful example \\nof environmentally responsible behavior.  The ch ance for students to interact and engage with \\ntribal members during the AIHI course series, and at times de velop friendships and bonds with \\nthe Cheyenne community develops an inferred va lue for the technologies and practices that can \\nhelp a community. \\n Conclusions and Recommendations  \\nThe contribution of the building en vironments to the depletion of  natural resources and energy \\nand water use in the US demand that increased emphasis is placed on embedding concepts of sustainability in construction e ngineering and management educa tion.

The assessment of how the AIHI cour se series affects the a ttitudes of students has \\ndemonstrated the benefit of the public scholar ship model in which sustainable practices are \\napplied by students in a community  in need, thus creating a lasti ng “real” value to sustainable \\ntechnologies in the minds of students.  This valu e is greatly amplified when students are able to \\nmake a connection with the community.  Also, by exposing students to a culture, such as the Northern Cheyenne, that is highly respectful of the environment, students are able to experience \\nan entirely different value system w ith respect to man and environment. \\n The public scholarship model a pplied by AIHI does provide a po rtable strategy for embedding \\nsustainability into existing courses by the adopti on of increased environmental considerations in \\nexisting engineering course projects and the appli cation of these projects to  communities in need.  \\nWhile the AIHI model may be difficult to duplicat e at other institutions , public scholarship can \\nbe integrated into existing design and construc tion courses to enable students to gain an \\nappreciation for the complexit y, importance and promise of sust ainable technologies to the \\nwelfare of communities.  \\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS \\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge support for the AIHI provided by the National Science \\nFoundation’s Division of Engineering Education & Centers (ENG/EEC).   \\nREFERENCES \\n \"The Stockholm D eclaration\", (1972).

In the \\nadaptation presented in this paper, the material  is summarized in a Powe rPoint presentation and \\nthe slides are printed on business card size pape r. Rather than presenting the material, the \\ninstructor provides teams of thr ee to four students with a comple te set of shuffled slides. The \\nteams are given the task of organizing the unsorte d material in mind maps. The class ends with a \\ncompetition in which teams must answer various material related questions. The article shows \\nhow to organize the material and th e class, points out the changes in  the role of the lecturer, and \\nalso recommends ways to better motivate students. \\nIntroduction \\n \\nA simple search on the Web will reveal over fifty learning and teaching theories (Kearsley 2005). However, these models fall in one of three categories descri bed below (Ryder 2005):  \\n1. Behaviorism  is based on the idea that behavi or can be observed, replicated and \\nconditioned without studying th e functions of the brain. Pa vlov’s experiments with \\nsalivating dogs are probably the most famous  applications of behaviorism in psychology, \\nbut this principle was used much earlier by Romans. The Romans simply referred to \\nbehaviorism as “repetitio ma ter studiorum est” (repetition is the mother of studying). \\nSimply put, behavioral teaching theories pr ovide for a sufficient number of problems or \\nexercises so the learner can efficien tly solve the next similar problem. \\n2. Cognitivism  is almost the opposite of behaviorism.  The cognitivist approach is based on \\nthe study of mental processes, attempting to build a “pyramid of knowledge”. An \\nillustrative way to present the cognitivist appr oach is credited to Edgar Dale (1959) and \\nreproduced in figure 1. Both behaviorism and cognitivism assume that knowledge is absolute and given \\n3. Constructivism  assumes that knowledge cannot be “transmitted” from one person to the \\nother and, thus, it has to be (re)constructed by the “recipient ”. The constructivist methods \\nare concerned with creating an environment for monitored peer  interaction and continuous \\nbuilding on known concepts. Collaborative learning is probably the most popular \\napplication of the cons tructivist approach.  \\nThe mere existence of more than fifty learning and teaching theories proves that no one theory \\ncan cover all the facets of teaching. This paper do es not attempt to provide yet another teaching \\ntheory.  \", mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Dale’s Cone of Learning (adapted from Dale 1959) \\n \\nInstead, this paper focuses solely on one teach ing method: concept mapping, and its application \\nto a specific type of problem. (References made to the broader theories of learning have the \\npurpose of putting the concept mapping in perspective.)  \\nConcept Mapping \\n \\nAs a teaching method, concept mapping is part of cognitivism. This means that the knowledge to \\nbe imparted is considered to be given and absolute (i.e. no ambiguities). According to Jan Lanzing (1997) “Concept mapping is a techni que for representing knowledge in graphs. \\nKnowledge graphs are networks of concepts. Ne tworks consist of nodes (points/vertices) and \\nlinks (arcs/edges). Nodes represen t concepts and links represent th e relations between concepts.”  \\n A simpler form of concept mapping is “Mind Mapping”, a term copyrighted by Tony Buzan in \\nthe UK and US. Mind maps are a subset of knowledge  graphs in the sense that they have a tree \\nstructure rather than a complex network (no loops), and there is  no detailing of the type of \\nrelationship between the nodes. While representati onally, mind maps may not be as accurate as \\nknowledge maps, mind maps are easier to teach a nd are more attractive to educators and to \\npeople who do not specialize in knowledge repres entation. According to Mindjet, one of several \\ninformation mapping software developers, Mind Mapping is used by over half of the Global 500 \\nCorporations (Mindjet 2005). Mind maps owe thei r success to the capacity of the human mind to \\ninterpret and supplement information presented gra phically on paper or other medium. They also \\nhelp focus on a single subject and its ramifications . To better serve the various types of learners, \\nmind maps are augmented with colors, pictures a nd variations in the th ickness of the branches. \\nMind Maps in Education \\n \\nTheoretically, the reason mind ma ps work better than other tec hniques is because they address \\nthe needs of several types of learners. According to Budd (2004)  “The construction of a Mind \\nMap provides a learning experience for visual an d tactile learners who are traditionally not as ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Budd further describe s an exercise in which he implemented the \\nprinciples of collaborative learning by having groups of three student s build mind maps. He \\nattempted to categorize the 39 stude nts participating in the study in to four different categories of \\nlearning styles (Kolb 1984): 1. ac tive experimentation (doing), 2. abstract conceptualization \\n(thinking), 3. reflective observation (watching), and 4. concrete experience  (feeling). The survey \\nrevealed information only about two types of  learners: “doers” and “thinkers”. Budd’s \\nconclusion is that “thinkers” feel that they le arn more from lectures than from building mind \\nmaps, while “doers” rank the two methods as be ing essentially the same. This conclusion seems \\nto be contradictory to the e xpectations set up by the theory and one may star t questioning the \\nwisdom of using mind maps in the classroom.   The literature survey did not reveal any super-s tudy on the efficiency of using mind maps as a \\nteaching tool. Reports of individual experiment s, such as Budd (2004) and Sivathasan and Ho \\n(2005) do not give an undisputab le educational advantage to mi nd maps and they advocate using \\nthem as a way to break the monotony of the class delivery systems. This conclusion is consistent \\nwith anecdotal information I received from co lleagues who have attempted using mind maps in \\ntheir classes. However, in a ll those experiments the mind maps were used to represent idea \\nstructures given  to the students. This paper reports on an approach in which the students are \\nasked to structure amorphous data.   \\nWhere Mind Maps Shine  \\n \\nIn essence, mind maps are similar to an outline. An outline is a list with levels of indentations, \\neach level having its own types of detailing and even tually different styles (letter size, color or \\nfont). In a mind map, the list is practically wrap ped around a central concept, and each level of \\ndetailing is a new branch in the tree. Due to this similarity, mind maps are more suited for \\nlearning topics in which an outline  already exists or can be easily derived. Colors and images are \\nused to enhance the meaning of the mind maps.  In the exercises described in the literature, the students are given structured material (such as a \\ntextbook chapter), and are asked to represent the material in a mind map. Essentially, the \\nstudents are asked to map the outline of the material . It should be no surpri se that the students are \\nambivalent to this methodology. While it exposes them to a new way of taking notes, the use of \\nmind maps does not provide any improvement of the depth of understanding or the speed at \\nwhich knowledge is acquired when a given text is mapped. There may be a benefit in the amount \\nof material retained at the end of the class, but that  benefit is probably o ffset by the fact that \\nsome class time has been spent on repeating the material and taking notes, which is normally \\ndone after class.   The conjecture proposed in this paper is that, in  education, mind maps shoul d be used to arrange \\ninformation that is originally pr esented in an unstructured fashi on. In other words, the material \\npresented to the students should be  complete but lacking structure,  similar to the notes taken at \\nthe end of a brain-storming sessi on. As a matter of fact, a closer  look at the uses suggested by \\nMindjet (2005), reveals brain-st orming as the top application of  mind mapping in businesses, \\ngovernment, education and home office.

How do we separate content from structure? \\n2. Are there any advantages in learning by rebui lding the structure of a given content?  \\n \\nSeparating content from structure  \\n \\nTo discuss the topic of teaching and learning, we  need to introduce a definition of the various \\nlevels of knowledge. Until 2001, the most wide ly accepted hierarchy of knowledge was one \\nproposed by Bloom (1956) under the name of Bloom’s taxonomy. Bloom’s taxonomy defines six \\nlevels of learning, ranking from lowest to highest: 1. Knowledge, 2. Comprehension, \\n3. Application, 4. Analysis, 5. Synthesis, and 6. Evaluation. In 2001 those levels were revised by \\nAnderson and Krathwohl (Ather ton 2005) to become: 1. Re membering, 2. Understanding, 3. \\nApplying, 4. Analyzing, 5. Evalua ting, and 6. Creating. These levels of knowledge build upon \\none another. Lower level knowledge must be acqui red before one can advance to the next level \\nof learning. The main differences between Bloom’s taxonomy and Anderson and Krathwohl’s \\ntaxonomy are at the higher levels of learning. The first four levels are pr actically identical.   \\n The two highest levels of learning, namely ev aluating and creating, are a culmination of the \\nlearning processes and require many hours of “lower level” learning. It  is this “lower level” of \\nlearning that is addressed by the mi nd mapping technique described below. \\n Consider, for instance, the task of teaching abou t a certain type of build ing material, such as \\nwood. Having the students read the material in  the book should suffice to learn the first two \\nlevels of knowledge (remembering and understanding) , yet most of the stude nts will probably be \\ndiscontent with such an approach and will lack the discipline required to retain (remember) the \\nmaterial. So, according to Edgar’s cone of learning  (see Figure 1), the rete ntion rate is only 10%. \\nThe current trend is for the instructor to pres ent the material in a lecture, usually using \\nPowerPoint sprinkled with some humor. With this  method, the expected rete ntion rate is between \\n30% and 50%. In one of the continuing educat ion classes I teach, I n eed about two hours to \\npresent the fifty slides referring to wood. At the end of the two hours, th ere is little time and \\nenergy left to go to the next two levels of know ledge, namely applicati on and analysis of the \\nknowledge.   According to Dalton and Smith (1986) the next tw o levels of learning are induced by asking the \\nfollowing types of questions: \\n1. Application - Do you know another instance wher e...?; Could this have happened in...?; \\nCan you group by characteristics such as...? \\n2. Analysis - How was this similar to...?; What  do you see as other possible outcomes?; Can \\nyou explain what must have happened when...? ; What are some of the problems of...?; \\nCan you distinguish between...? \\nGetting students to answer those questions at the end of one lecture is difficult not only because \\nthey have little energy left, but also because they need more than the 30% to 50% of the material \\npresented in the lecture to be able to answer the questions. \\n The exercise described below overcomes this pr oblem by addressing the first four levels of \\nlearning in a very efficient way.

Each team is given a shuffled  stack of business-card size printouts of \\nthe PowerPoint slides, one larg e sheet of paper (27\" x 34\" eas el sheets work well for this \\npurpose), glue, adhesive tape and colored felt-tip pens. The teams are then asked to organize all \\nthe slides in a mind map. This ex ercise takes place in two rounds. \\n First round is a competition between the te ams on the time it takes to produce a quality mind \\nmap. The first team to finish the mind map ha ngs it on the white board, followed by the second \\nteam, third and so on, thus forming a queue. As th ey come up to the white board, each team is \\nthen asked to “question” the map of the previous  team. If they can find logical mistakes in the \\nmind map, and those mistakes are endorsed by the in structor, the team with the faulty map goes \\nto the end of the queue. At the end of this r ound, each member of the top three teams receives a \\nreward. The reward can be either an object such as an apple, a tootsie roll, a trinket or some \\nbonus points that can be used late r in the semester. I have found that, contrary to what one may \\nfirst think, only about one in thirty  students will benefit from a grade increase (say from a B to an \\nA) when bonus points are awarded  (Wiezel 1998).   Second Round  - Questions. There are two levels at wh ich the second round of the data mapping \\nexercise can be played. At the lower level, the in structor can ask questions  of the type described \\nby Dalton (see point 1 and 2 in the previous  section). The student who answers first and points \\nto the right place on his or her team’s mind map r eceives a reward. This level is a “learning how \\nto learn” level and is used in the first few data mapping exercises with  the class, when the \\nstudents are not yet used to as king questions. The main purpose of  this level is to teach the \\nstudents about the type of questions that can be  asked. In the higher level of the second round, \\nthe students are asked to pose questions to th e class. The instructor then judges the quality \\n(value) of the question. If the que stion is “a good question”, the au thor of the question and the \\nrespondent are both rewarded. Alternatively, the quality of the question can be judged by the \\nlength of time it takes to identify the answer on the mind map.  \\nTricks and Tips to the Teacher \\n \\nThis section presents the lessons I have lear ned during the past two years while using mind \\nmapping exercises in some of my classes.  \\n1. Mind mapping works well for topics that need  roughly 50 slides to be covered. This \\namount of material is hard to follow in a regular PowerPoint presentation and is \\nchallenging enough to make the mind map exercise useful. \\n 2. If you have topics that spread over more than one slide, provide  hints in the title. Students \\nneed to be able to work with “chunks” of  information. Some of the questions in the \\n“second round” (see previous section) can be  directed towards information hidden in \\nthose “chunks” to ensure that students read the information on each slide.

It is best to introduce the idea of mind mappi ng with an example of material presented in \\nclass. Start by delivering a regular PowerP oint lecture then di stribute handouts and \\n11”x17” printouts of the mind map (see point 4 below) repr esenting the same material. \\nHave the students identify the informati on and its links on the mind map. I use some \\njokes in the delivery of the PowerPoint presentation, and then show on the mind map \\nwhere I made a joke in the PowerPoint. This helps make an easy reference to particular \\nslides that students are now more likely to remember.  \\n \\n4. To build a mind map in PowerPoint first save  the sequential (50 slides) presentation as \\nGIF or JPEG, then open a new PowerPoint pres entation, set the page size to 11”x17”, and \\nimport each slide as an image. Select all th e images and re-size simultaneously. Use the \\nfreeform line tool to draw the branches.  \\n \\n5.

The \\nhandouts of these files contain six instances of the same slide on each printed page. To generate a file of “Mixed Slates” follow the steps below: \\na. Generate a randomized list of the numbers of the slides.  \\nb. Open the PowerPoint file and save it under a different name. (This will ensure \\nthat you do have the original sequence of slid es.) You will need th e original file to \\nprint handouts that the students will take home.  \\nc. In the new file, move the slides in the positions indicated by the randomized list. \\nThis can be done programmatically, using VBA, but it is not always worth the \\neffort of writing and debugging a program.  \\nd. Add five copies to each slide, so that you have sets of six identical slides, one \\nafter another. If you started with 50 slides th is will increase your file to 300 slides.  \\ne. Save the file and print handouts of 6 s lides per page. You now have as many \\npages as original slides and on each page you have 6 business-card size images of \\nthe same slide.  \\nf. Cut out the slides following the cuttin g schema presented the appendix. You will \\nhave 6 sets of shuffled presentations. (You may need several sets of 6 for one \\nclass.) \\nConclusion \\n \\nDuring mind map building, students have to read each slide several times and consider how the \\ninformation on a particular slide links to “the bigger picture”. The tw o rounds of a mind mapping \\nexercise will take together about 60% of the time it takes to deliver the same  material in a lecture \\nformat. This was a surprising finding considering th at students have to rebuild the data structure \\nthat has been discarded. Usually, the teams will quickly distribute the work between them and \\neach team member becomes an expert in a few br anches of the mind map. There is a lot of slide \\ntrading between “experts” and they start questio ning the position of each slide on the map. The \\nexercise is very dynamic and the instructor should be comfortable in having the class in disorder.  \\n If the instructor is successful in implemen ting level two of the second round, the mind map \\nexercise will cover al six leve ls of learning as presented in Bloom’s taxonomy.

Construction is a highly inte rdisciplinary profession whose \\nbody of knowledge has grown sin ce its formal conception several decades ago to reflect the \\nmanifold dimensions of the projects that cons truction engineers and construction managers are \\ncontrolling. New learning models ne ed to be explored in teaching to avert the risk of conveying \\nthis knowledge to students at th e undergraduate level in a frag mented and irrelevant manner. \\nThis paper presents an innovative teamwork appr oach used in a sequence of two undergraduate \\nconstruction courses at The Cat holic University of America (C UA). Following an introduction of \\nstudent-centered learning, the Construction Management Consulting Project  is outlined in its \\nmajor phases and features, includ ing its realistic scenarios, its modular integration with \\nclassroom knowledge, and its review and fina l documentation. They are linked with the six \\nlevels of competence in Bloom’s taxonomy of learning and consid er different l earning styles. \\nResearch studies have confirmed the success of such project-based and student-centered learning \\nenvironments. The paper concludes with feedback  from students and with recommendations for \\nimplementing learning experiences that actively e ngage students to grow into the leaders of \\ntomorrow’s construction industry. \\nIntroduction \\nConstruction engineering and management educa tion needs to give students the technical and \\npersonal skills for being successful in a practical work environment where they will solve real \\nproblems in the complex interplay of the various di mensions of the project. Construction itself is \\nthe youngest and most interdisciplin ary specialization within civil engineering. Its research areas \\nand teaching agendas have been developing dyn amically since its inception as a separate \\ndiscipline. Characteristic are the breadth of topics  that it encompasses, e.g. scheduling, \\nestimating, operations planning, and contract administration, and th e many additional fields from \\nwhich it draws specialized knowledge applicable to the successful plan ning and execution of \\nconstruction projects. For construc tion courses in an undergraduate curriculum this wide array of \\ntopics poses a challenge to not present a fr agmented accumulation of the construction body of \\nknowledge within the limited amount  of time, but to achieve a m eaningful and deep integration. \\nNeeds in Construction Education \\nSeveral authors have contemplated the current situation and future demands on education in \\nconstruction engineering and management. Bordo gna (1998, p48) argues th at in light of the \\n“increasingly complex and interconnected” nature of  the systems that sustain our lifestyle in its \\n“social, economic, environmental, legal, and political” setting, ther e is an ever-growing need to ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

He criticizes that “[p] resent curricula require student \\nto learn in unconnected pieces, separate courses whose relationships to one another and to the \\nengineering process are not expl ained until late in a baccalaureat e education, if ever” and calls \\nfor ways to allow students to become “mas ter integrators” (Bordogna 1998, p49-50). Earlier, \\nJester (1990) had encouraged bringing a stronger systems perspective into  the civil engineering \\ncurriculum. Fondahl (1991) had also emphasized  developing teamwork skills in students to \\nprepare them for their roles in the professi onal relationship between owner, engineer, and \\ncontractor. The consensus nowadays is that  communication, teamwork, systemic thinking, \\ncreativity and an understanding of societal issues are important pieces of engineering education, \\nadding value to the traditional analytical em phasis on mathematics and the natural sciences. \\nMore than ever before the old saying applies that  engineers are hired for their technical skills, \\nfired for their lack of people skills, and promot ed for their management and leadership skills. \\nSawhney and Mund (1998, p1319) stressed previous research findings that “students learn more \\neffectively and permanently when they can activ ely participate in the learning process” and \\nunderlined the need for integrated learning, as “c urricula do not give students a holistic view of \\ntheir field of study” but fragment the informati on into many specialized but unconnected courses. \\nSenior (1997, p45), in hi s discussion of simulations  and case-based instructio n in construction, is of \\nthe opinion that “[p]ractical activ ities are probably more importan t than theory in this field.” \\nChinowsky and Vanegas (1996) sup port returning to an educationa l approach that is generalist \\nand sought by industry employers, noting that  the focus on modeling and simulation of \\nconstruction operations has furthered the fragment ation. The consulting proj ect described in this \\npaper turns their vision of an integrated learning system specifically for construction \\nmanagement into reality. In particular, different  from the case studies criticized by Rojas and \\nMukherjee (2005) as being limited due to missing context, the consulting project provides a rich \\nsituational learning enviro nment in which the student s themselves create most  of the materials under \\nthe guidance of the instructor. \\nStudent-Centered Learning Philosophy \\nStudent-centered learning is an approach that re conciles the confusion that oftentimes exists in \\nthe exact use of the terms teaching and lear ning. Using the analogy of manufacturing for the \\neducational process, teaching is to learning what the process is to the product. One could also \\ncompare the teacher-centered style to a ‘push’ m odel in the manufacturi ng chain and the student-\\ncentered style to a ‘pull’ model. Cannon (2000) defines student-centered learning as a new way \\nof thinking about education:  \\nStudent-centred learning describes wa ys of thinking about learning and teaching \\nthat emphasise student responsibility fo r such activities as planning learning, \\ninteracting with teachers, and other students, researching, and assessing \\nlearning.  \\nThe student-centered learning philosophy thus puts  much weight on the students as the clients \\nand beneficiaries of, and indeed the reason for th e entire educational proc ess. Since students are \\ngiven more freedom and responsibility for their own learning progress unde r this approach and \\nare expected to be active particip ants rather than merely passive  recipients, it may initially be \\nmet with uncertainty and irr itation by them. However, numer ous studies, e.g. Barr and Tagg \\n(1995) have shown that student-cen tered learning yields more lasti ng educational experiences, as ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The spirit of student-centered lear ning is fully reflected in the eleven Engineering Criteria 2000 \\nof the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET), whose new approach \\nfocuses on learning outcome (Abudayyeh et al. 2000), not on teaching input, and includes \\nproblem solving in teamwork among its require ments. As Cannon (2000) explains, project-based \\ninstruction is an excellent wa y to incorporate student-centere d learning into an engineering \\ncurriculum. The following sections describe th e innovative student-cente red approach of the \\nconstruction management consulting project (CMC P), an extensive teamwork activity spanning \\ntwo consecutive undergraduate courses of the Construction Engineering and Management \\nProgram at The Catholic University of America (CUA). \\nConsulting Project Features \\nThe semester project is a semi-r ealistic construction project. Work ing in teams of four, students \\nact as construction management consultants (CMC) to the owner, who in this role-play is \\nembodied by the instructor. The CMC teams are tasked with developing full guidelines for a \\nsuccessful execution and completion of their project. The results of  these efforts are documented \\nin a comprehensive project execution manual. The design only is taken to the level of detail of \\nline drawings with a plan view of the space layout and landscaping and elevations of the \\nstructure. The following table of contents list s items addressed by the CMC teams in order of \\ntheir typical occurrence in the project de livery process: Feasibility, marketing, and \\nenvironmental impact studies, preliminary desi gn and specifications, engi neering, estimating and \\nbid preparation, permits and approvals, financ ing arrangements, planning, organizational \\nstructure and interface coordina tion, staffing, suppliers and proc urement, schedule preparation \\nwith milestones and incentives, contract deve lopment and administration, construction means \\nand methods, safety program, quality control, de velopment of project controls, turnover and \\nstart-up preparations, facility operations and maintenance, cash flow forecasting, and other \\nrequirements as deemed necessary. Specifics of the project and its site  are a combination of \\nactual data, e.g. materials and labor costs, a nd justifiable engineer ing assumptions, e.g. \\nforecasted rental or sales revenues. The estimat e and schedule are based on a preliminary take-\\noff with about 75 activities. Scenarios includ e a new engineering building at CUA, a 15,000 m\\n2 \\ntwo-story anchor store for a mall, an upper-scale fitness and health spa cl ub, a country club with \\nsupport facilities, a 10,000 m2 multi-story senior citizens’ resi dence, and a 250-slip marina to \\ndock and service pleasure craft. \\nLevels of Learning and Project Elements \\nBloom’s (1984) classic taxonomy of learning has been implemented in designing countless \\neducational programs.

Regular lectur es, including guest lectures by industry \\nexperts and visits at various t ypes of construction sites, contin ued during the project work in \\ntopical modules that built on the pr evious semester in a sequence that was coordinated with the \\ndeveloping project materials. Proj ect activities were woven into the schedule to complement the \\nclassroom sessions. \\nInitial Work and Consulting \\nAt the onset of the project, the owner and th e CMC teams extensively discussed the desired \\nnature of the completed facilities with respec t to scope, location, desi gn, and functional details. \\nAfterwards, the owner was flexibly available as requested by the CMC teams. While not required \\nin the original assignment, several CMC t eams visited their resp ective project location, \\ninvestigated its surroundings, and selected a specific site, which they documented in digital \\nphotos and later included in the project execu tion manual, in some cases with CAD renderings \\ninserted into the photos. \\nProgress Review and Report \\nAbout halfway through the consultin g project the CMC teams partic ipated in a progress review \\nto keep the owner informed of the progress achieved in planning th e project. Part of the review \\nwas the written progress report with  a depth approximately equivalent  to a 50% design review. It \\ncontained at least a formal desc ription of the progress, areas id entified to still be addressed, \\nmajor concerns and suggested solutions, and aspect s of the project that ar e typically completed at \\nan early date, e.g. location and environmental setting, a prelim inary design contract type, \\norganizational structure, and feasibility, ma rketing, and environmental impact studies. \\nThe CMC teams met with the owner in a review se ssion for which they were asked to select and \\nformally present specific issues. Should competi ng options exist for a particular issue they were \\nasked to develop such alternatives in sufficient detail, present their advantages and disadvantages \\nto the owner, and receive guidance in choosing. Each team was given extensive feedback, both \\nduring the meeting as well as in  written comments, on the work that they had performed, and \\ndirections for continuation of the wo rk and potential areas of improvement. \\nProject Execution Manual and Presentation \\nAt the conclusion of the two-semester course sequence, the CMC teams prepared a project \\nexecution manual with its detailed explanations of each topic. A sample tabl e of contents as listed \\nabove under Consulting Proj ect Features had b een provided. The teams were  briefed about elements \\nof good presentations, effective use of visual aids, and rhetorics skills to pr epare them for their oral \\n25-minute presentations. Presentations required partic ipation of all team me mbers and were open to \\nthe university public. The School  of Engineering at CUA was e quipped with several “smart \\nclassrooms” whose informat ion technology the teams could use for their presentations. Audience \\nmembers commente d favorably on the quality of the work products and the professi onalism with \\nwhich they were presented. Evaluation and grad ing of the manual and th e presentation strongly \\nconsidered that in reality these materials should  ultimately convince th e owner to hire the CMC \\nteam as experts for co nsulting on the actual construction project. \\nAssessment Techniques \\nAll aspects of the consulting project are consider ed to determine the over all grade.

An intermediate survey questionnaire  with open-ended questio ns was distributed at \\nmid-semester and a survey was again distributed at  the conclusion of each semester in addition to \\nthe official university course evaluation. Thes e snapshots of the students’ perception allowed \\ngaining insights into developments during the project. The following representative \\ntranscriptions are a sampling of the students’ reflections on the course sequence, the consulting \\nproject, communication, and teamwork from both th e original course evaluations and from the \\nsurveys. \\nPlease give your opinion about the course: \\nThe project helped in pulling everything together [.] Helped in my greater understanding \\nof the basic fundamentals of const. [ruction]  management [.] \\nWhat is the idea or concept that  will stay with you the longest? \\nThe concept of working as a group. The group project helped me understand the \\ncomplete concept of const. management. The semester project helped me underst and the construction process very well. \\nWhat have you learned about construction m anagement through this semester project? \\nI learned a lot about the overall construction pr ocess and all that is involved in getting a \\nproject off the ground [.] \\nAm[oun] t of planning + coordination that  goes into construction B4 [before]  construction \\n+ the importance to do so. \\nThere is a lot that goes into a project. Communication is probably the most important \\npart of construction management. \\nWhat have you learned about teamwork  through this semester project? \\nit is difficult to coordinate  Architect + Engineers, esp ecially when randomly chosen [.] \\nthat commitment, flexibility, and fairness is  essential for a team project's success. \\nIt’s not easy, but with good communica tion you can have a successful project. \\nA former student who now works as an Office En gineer with a major construction contracting \\ncompany wrote in retrospective: \\nThe project definitely he lped in the bringing together of  the various aspects and smaller \\ndisciplines that make up construction management  as a whole. Being able to see and help \\nguide a project from a concept to a reality proved very exciting, but for me however, the \\nmost important aspect was the opportunity to  function as part of a team. Evaluating the \\nteam members, focusing everyone on their i ndividual strengths and coming together for \\nbrainstorming sessions is what I believe led to  successful project.

Hackshaw, Class of 2005 \\nRecommendations And Conclusion \\nBased on several years’ worth of  experience since first implemen ting the consulting project at \\nCUA, the author believes that it o ffers the opportunity for a rich educational experience in a fully \\nstudent-centered learning environment. If impl emented at a university program in construction \\nengineering and management, its se mi-realistic project scenarios should be located in the vicinity \\nof the campus so that the students on the CM C teams can relate to the location, and through \\nvisiting it and researching actual da ta pertaining to the particular s ite achieve a degree of realism \\nthat is just one step below performing real fi eld work for a construc tion contractor during a \\nsummer internship. One improvement planned for upcoming iterations of the consulting project \\nis stronger industry involvement. Representative s of the regional construction industry, e.g. from \\nthe departmental advisory board  as recommended by Abudayyeh et  al. (2000) or from the many \\nCUA alumni in the metropolitan region, coul d become engaged beyond serving as guest \\nspeakers; rather, the CMC teams could be assi gned industry mentors who could share their \\nexperiences during project devel opment, facilitate visits to  the offices of construction \\nmanagement companies, and would also form an expert panel to whom the final presentation is \\ngiven. Moreover, student comments support the a ddition of a peer evaluation component to the \\noverall assessment, including self-evaluation of th eir own performance as described by Riley et \\nal. (2004). Such team evaluation can use a range of  questions that measure various aspects of the \\nteamwork. Each question would carry 100 points that the students distribute among all team \\nmembers. Equal points would represent equal cont ributions by each team member. The instructor \\nthen calculates the average percent for each pe rson and multiplies it with the project grade to \\nobtain the individual grades. Open -ended questions should be incl uded in the questionnaire to \\ncapture any issues that the stude nts consider essential in reflec ting upon their learning experience \\nwith the consulting project. \\nAcknowledgement \\nThe author would like to thank Dr .

As predicted, craft shortages appear to have worsen ed.  Recently, a study by the Construction Users \\nRoundtable in 2001 indicated widespread and worsening work force shortages. Several factors have contributed to the craft shortages in cluding declining real wages, unattr active industry image, poor work \\nenvironment, lack of stable worker career paths, an d insufficient training opportunities for craft workers.  \\nAddressing the training needs of the construction wo rk force is a first step towards assuring that an \\nadequate work force will be available in the future.  While there is resi stance to training from both some \\ncompanies’ reluctance to provide training and crafts’ resistance to receive it, training does exist in many forms from formal apprentice programs to informal on -the-job training experiences.  This paper reviews \\nknown issues that craft workers experience with the different forms of craft training, including \\nexperiences in both the union and open-shop sectors. Next, the paper examines programs utilized by the \\nconstruction industry to promote craft training, which include craft certification programs, funding mechanisms to promote training, and income support systems for craft workers to enable their pursuit of training.  Known deficiencies of these and other programs are reviewed as well.  Finally, the paper outlines an approach to quantify the effectiveness of craft training.   \\nAlthough some of the observations apply to all construction, our focus is primarily on industrial \\nconstruction work.    \\nIntroduction \\n \\nThe union sector of the construction industry tr aditionally has conducted the bulk of training of \\nskilled craft workers.  In 1982, the Busine ss Roundtable Construction Industry Cost \\nEffectiveness Project Report reported that th e union sector provided 90 percent and the open-\\nshop sector provided 10 percent of the expenditures on formal training, even though 60 percent \\nof the construction market was open shop a nd 40 percent union (The Business Roundtable, \\n1982).   The 1982 Roundtable report forecasted severe work  force shortages in th e open-shop sectors if \\nmore effort was not employed to recruit and deve lop future craft workers.  As predicted, craft \\nshortages appear to have worsened.  Several recent reports have i ndicated widespread and \\nworsening work force shortages (Business Roundtable, 1997; CURT, 2001; Construction \\nIndustry Institute, 2003).

The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects a \\nneed for additional 125,000 craft workers annually both to fill new jobs and to replace workers leaving their jobs.   The problem is not just lack of training opportun ities but also overcoming an unattractive image \\nto successfully recruit and attract workers to the industry and to find ways to keep them \\nemployed.  Addressing the training needs of the c onstruction work force is a first step towards \\nassuring that an adequate work force will be availa ble in the future.  While there is resistance to \\ntraining from both some companies’ reluctance to provide training and crafts’ resistance to \\nreceive it, training does exist in many forms, ranging from formal  apprentice programs, to short-\\ncourse task training, to informal on-the-job training experiences.   \\n \\nPrograms to Promote Craft Training  \\n \\nIn the union sector .  The union sector has deve loped training institut ions to cope with \\nthe problems raised by constr uction labor markets where atta chment between workers and \\nindividual employers is casual, jobs and job sites are ever cha nging, and employment is subject \\nto cyclical and seasonal fluctuations.  In this  environment, individual employers tend to under-\\ninvest in training because they fear losing th eir investment as workers who move to other \\nemployers.  Multi-employer sponsorship and tr aining trust funds negot iated through collective \\nbargaining help alleviate this problem by offeri ng a means to share the benefits and costs of \\ntraining among all stakeholders in the industry— workers, contractors, and unions. Whether or \\nnot contractors train apprentices themselves, a ll firms pay the same negotiated rate per hour \\nworked into a dedicated training fund.  The rate va ries widely by trade and area.  In some trades, \\na portion of this rate goes to national tr aining funds, administered by national joint \\napprenticeship and training committees. The general mission of these national training funds is to \\nimprove the quality and uniformity of training.  The national funds commission studies of future \\ntechnology and developments affecting the craf t, develop curriculum materials and conduct \\ninstructor training, make arrangements for college credit, monitor the qual ity of local programs, \\nand provide special traini ng assistance or equipment where it is needed.  \\n While the union sector represented an estimated  20 percent of the construction market, they \\nsponsored nearly three-quarters  of the registered apprenti ceships during the period 1996-2003 \\n(Glover and Bilginsoy, 2005).  Ov erall, jointly sponsored progra ms have higher enrollments, \\ngreater participation by minorities and wome n, and enjoy significantly higher rates of \\napprenticeship completion than registered appr enticeships sponsored by employers alone.  Yet \\neven among jointly sponsored prog rams, more than half of appr enticeships are cancelled and a \\nlarge portion of these were cancelled early in the apprenticeship before significant skill acquisition could occur. Partic ipation of women remains low, which effectively limits the \\navailable pool of applicants to the industry.

For example, it is \\noften difficult for local union officials–who must stand for elections regular ly– to agree to start \\nsufficient numbers of apprentices in a decl ining market with journeymen union members \\nunemployed.  Also, many union members reach journeymen status without completing an apprenticeship.  Some unionized  employers question whether th e apprenticeship system is \\nefficient and what return they are getting for their mandated investment. \\n \\nTraining developments in the open shop .  Most non-union constr uction contractors do \\nnot sponsor registered apprenticeships.  In fact , until the last decade or so, only a few of the \\nlargest firms sponsored much formal training at  all.  While open-shop contractors respect the \\nskills produced by apprenticeship, especially in th e mechanical trades (electrical work, plumbing \\nand pipefitting, sheet metal and air conditioning work ), they favor more flexible, less formal and \\nshorter-term methods.  Many open-shop employers te nd to offer task training on an “as needed” \\nor “just in time” basis.  The non-union sector al so tends to place greater responsibility for skill \\ndevelopment on schools and individual workers.  \\n A long-standing problem in open-shop construction ha s been the lack of institutions to organize \\nand fund training as well as establishment of a consensus on skill standards and certifications.  In \\n1995, eleven large national construction companies and several national cont ractor associations \\nestablished the National Center for Construc tion Education and Research (NCCER) as a non-\\nprofit education foundation at th e University of Florida “to address the severe workforce \\nshortage facing our industry and to develop industry driven sta ndardized craft training programs \\nwith portable credentials” (NCCE R, 2006).  The NCCER has deve loped curricula, assessments, \\nand certifications for 22 construction specialty skill areas, and, in collaboration with the American Petroleum Institute, another 15 spec ialty skill area in pipeline installation and \\nmaintenance. Curriculum development has been an emphasis since the inception of NCCER in \\n1995.  Current curriculum materials as published as the Contren® Learning Series. NCCER has \\nalso negotiated arrangements for college  credit for learning in NCCER training. \\n NCCER offers craft certification for individuals through written te sts and performance testing.  \\nCraft workers who pass both the wr itten and the performance certif ication tests are designated by \\nNCCER as “Certified Plus” craft workers.  Cer tified craft workers are listed on an electronic \\nNational Registry that is accessible by participat ing employers. In addition to certifying the skills \\nof individuals, the NCCER has begun an initiativ e to review and accredit construction training \\nprograms in high schools, community colleges and proprietary schools.  To facilitate funding of traini ng programs, the NCCER has established a National Training \\nService Agreement.  Through this voluntary agre ement, participating contractors contribute 15 \\ncents per craft labor hour worked into an i ndividual account that NCCER establishes and \\nmaintains for the contractor.  Of the hourly cont ributions, 13 cents are available to be reimbursed \\nto the contractor on submission of appropriate invoices for training expenses.  The remaining 2 \\ncents are used for national activities such as curriculum revision and updating, maintenance of \\nthe National Registry, and program development.

Maintenance offers more steady wo rk and is typically characterized \\nby relatively low turnover of craft personnel, whic h fosters training.  In contrast, construction \\ncapital projects involve a temporary buildup of work force.  Staffing “green field” sites located in \\nisolated rural areas away from population centers can be especially difficult.  Perhaps the most \\nchallenging types of projects to staff are “outages” or “turnarounds” because they generate huge \\nshort-term demands for workers.  Due to cyc lical certification requirements on machinery and \\nthe needs to get ready for peak seasonal dema nds, major construction owners find themselves \\nwith little flexibility in coordi nating the timing of outages with owners of nearby facilities. The \\nresults are often extraordinary peaks in  employment that are not sustained. \\n \\nDiffering time horizons from various perspectives .  Time horizons differ significantly \\nby perspective.  A traveling contractor coming into  an area for a limited duration capital project, \\na contractor who stays in area (c loser to an industry perspective) , a worker seeking a short-term \\njob, worker seeking a lifetime career, the indus try as a whole, the government—all these have \\ndifferent perspectives and different time hor izons.  The time horizon is important because it \\ndetermines the period over which benefits accrue in a return-on-investment framework. \\n \\nNature of the tasks and skills involved .  Some projects involve “one of a kind” or \\nunique functions; others feature a significant proportion of repeti tive tasks. Projects with high \\nproportions of repetitive tasks are more suitable to task training.  Also, the shortage situation \\nvaries by craft; some construction skills are in especially shor t supply (e.g., currently certain \\nwelding specialties and boilermakers).  A ch allenge with construction work and training \\ngenerally is that many of the craft jobs require significant skill levels that cannot be acquired \\novernight or learned quickly. Further, most cons truction skills cannot be taught effectively in a \\nclassroom alone.  They are best learned in a comb ination of classroom and worksite venues.  The \\nskills must be learned and practiced on the job through experiential learni ng; but without being \\nproperly structured and organize d, learning on the job can interfer e with productivity and safety. \\n \\nBreadth of training/skills developed .  The possible breadth of  craft training ranges from \\nindividual task training to full craft training to training in seve ral crafts.  Confusion over the \\ndefinitions of the terms “multi-skilling” and “multi-crafting” obscure these topics.  Some union spokesperson have resisted or objected to the te rms “multi-skilling” and “multi-crafting,” yet at \\nthe same time, most union sector apprenticeships  cover multiple skills or crafts (depending on \\ndefinitions).  Union officials recognize that the broad training offered in apprenticeships allows a \\nworker to be employed more continuous ly and facilitates job referral.   \\n Multi-skilling offers potential benefits to workers and employers alike.

Analysis by Haas et al (1998 and 1999)  has revealed that wh ile there are significant \\nbenefits to employing multiskilled workers on a project, there are limits to the returns of \\nproportions of multiskilled workers on a constructi on project. But some critics wonder even how \\nmulti-skilling can be considered when funding for ev en single-craft training is so insufficient. \\n \\nAs important as technical craft skills are, wh ether these skills are ac tually used on project \\nis equally vital.  Borcherding et al (2001) out lined a fuller vision of the trained worker in \\nconstruction in the “Tier II strategy” and develo ped metrics to measure implementation of this \\nconcept.  The Tier II journeyman is well prepared  in management skills, including such skills as \\ncost management, computer use, and short-interval planning.  In addition, the Tier II project is \\norganized to facilitate craft wo rkers using their technical and ma nagement skills. This includes \\ndesigning projects with high performance work team s who have full authority and information to \\nmake full use of their skills. \\n    \\nPromising Approaches to Promote Craft Training \\n \\nEfforts are currently underway to overcome the ba rriers and challenges that  have hampered craft \\ntraining in the past.  These include the following:  \\nSkill certification .  The problem with certification in th e past is that there have been no \\ngenerally accepted industry-wide  standards in the nonunion sector .  With the development of \\nNCCER certification, industry sta ndards are coming into place.  They are not perfect and do not \\nyet have the confidence of all in  the industry; but th e standards and certifi cation procedures are \\nimproving over time.  Certificat ion of craft workers is in creasingly required by major \\nconstruction owners as part of the bidding qualifi cations for all their cons truction contractors and \\nsubcontractors. In part, these requirement are mo tivated by a perceived dec line in the quality of \\ncraft workers over time.   For example, in  November 2005, ExxonMobil began requiring Craft \\nSkill Certification for all craftworkers among its cont ractors and specified the certifications to be \\nused.  The allowable certificati ons include completion of an appr enticeship in the union sector \\nand NCCER “certified plus” certifica tions in the open-shop sector. \\n \\nMechanisms for funding craft training .  The challenge of filling the needs for craft \\ntraining requires funding, which can come from only three sources: the fi rm, the individual being \\ntrained, and/or the government. Ideally a collabor ative approach involving  all three sources is \\nneeded.  Individuals pay by investing their time in training, by cash payments for tuition, or by \\naccepting lower-than-market wages during the te rm of their training.  The union-sector \\napprenticeship model and the NCCER training serv ice offer two examples of approaches to \\novercome the special challenges posed  by construction labor markets. \\n \\nTraining evaluation and the business case for craft training \\n \\nIn contrast to other industries , little research has been devot ed to evaluating the returns to \\ntraining in construction (Glover et al, 1999).

C onsidering that a myriad of factors simultaneously \\nimpact construction performance on a jobsite, it  was determined that directly measuring the \\nimpact of craft training on say a crew’s produc tivity was not feasible or would likely produce \\nunreliable results.  Instead, this  CII research effort has outli ned the framework for a decision \\nmaking system that proposes a meta-analysis to utilize a series of cas e studies and existing \\ndatasets that document organizations’ experien ces with their training effort through both \\nquantitative and qualitative evidence.  It is anticipated that this e xpert-type system would be used \\nto provide answers that industry commonly encount er when engaged in cr aft training decisions \\nsuch as how companies can maximize their traini ng return-on-investment, the effects of training \\non an individual worker, and the reasons why more craft workers do not seek training.. \\n \\nConclusion \\n \\nContinuing demand for craft workers in the f ace of increasing reports of shortages of \\nqualified workers and declines in th e quality of applicants for cons truction jobs prompt a need to \\nexamine sources of construction training.  Without  significant increases in  craft training and \\nresulting improvements in the availa bility and quality of skilled cr aft workers, the future of the \\nconstruction industry is at risk. The current training infrastructure  in construction consists of \\napprenticeship training, company cr aft progression programs, community colleges, trade schools, \\nschool-to-career programs, national cooperative tr aining efforts, military construction force \\ntraining, and various forms of structured or unstr uctured on-the job-traini ng (OJT).  The question \\nremains, however, of how effective training e fforts are in construction.  Although training has \\nmany logical positive impacts on construction perfo rmance, such as produ ctivity, quantifying the \\nimpact is not always possible, at least in a di rect manner.

The enduring chal lenge for professional service firms is how to \\ncapture and amplify the benefits from innovatio n activity across fragil e individual knowledge \\nworker to individual knowledge work er, and project to project boundaries. \\n This paper presents empirical findings from a longitudinal case study on the role of leadership \\nand innovation championing in a small architectural  practice in the United Kingdom.   The case \\nstudy consisted of exploratory a nd action research phases.   Th e findings indicate that senior \\nmanagers have a critical role in nurturing a nd harnessing the creative tension between fragile, \\nintrinsic motivations of individual professiona ls and agile extrinsic motivation to develop \\ncorporate-wide dynamic capabilities and sustainable competitive advantage. \\n \\n \\nInstruction \\n \\nThe central question we address in this paper is  the role of senior managers in successful \\ninnovation in small construction professional servic e firms.

It is ar gued that the knowledge possessed \\nby ‘staff’ represent a key sour ce of sustainable competi tive advantage for individual \\norganisations (Raich, 2002), countries (Por ter, 1990) and trading blocs (EC, 2004). \\n The services offered by these professional servi ce firms (PSFs) are characterised by being highly \\nknowledge intensive in nature.  Th ere is significant agreement th at the principal means by which \\nthis growing body of PSFs create value is thro ugh the successful creation and management of \\nknowledge.   It is argued that highly qualified knowledge workers are the catalyst for managing \\nknowledge within PSFs (Alvesson, 2001).  This is consistent with the recognition that \\nappropriate human capability with in construction firms is vital for successful innovation and \\nperformance improvement in the cons truction industry (Slaughter, 1998). \\n An important starting point in this literature is the ‘service’ dimension of PSFs.  ‘A service’ has \\nbeen usefully described as “a process consisting of  a series of more or less intangible activities \\nthat normally, but not necessarily always, take place in interactions be tween the customer and \\nservice employees and/or physical resources or goods and/or systems of the service provider, \\nwhich are provided as solutions to customer problem” (Grönroos, 2000:46).  The core of the \\ndefinition is that the generation of successful services demands a high degree of interaction and \\nco-production of the service prov ision between the client and th e service provider (Hansson, \\n2002).  Extending the service concept to professional serv ices, Hill and Neely (1988) \\ncharacterise a ‘professional service’ as one wher e the client is signifi cantly dependent on the \\nprovider to define the problem a nd give appropriate advice.   \\n The literature then moves on to argue that the principal ‘provider’ of these services is the \\nknowledge worker (Despres and H iltrop, 1995).  A ‘professional’ is considered as “someone \\nwho can act independently while bringing a body of special knowledge to bear in a work \\nsituation” (Shapero, 1985:21).  Re turning back to the services concept, services undertaken by \\nprofessionals have been referred to as knowle dge based services (Wood, 2001).  The grouping \\ntogether of professionals to provide services to clients is known as a knowledge-intensive \\norganisation (Alvesson, 2001).    In summary, PSFs in a construction context have  four principal charac teristics: professional \\nservices are knowledge-intensive in nature; pr ofessional services are delivered by knowledge \\nworkers; but, professional se rvices are nonetheless co-produced  between the knowledge worker \\nand the client; and, the majority of constructi on professional servic es are provided by small \\nfirms.  PSFs thus have unique ch aracteristics (when compared to other types of firms), and these \\ncharacteristics have a significant impact on the focus and nature of  innovation activity.  The next \\nsection will thus focus on innova tion within this context. \\n \\nInnovation within small knowledge-int ensive profession al service firms \\n \\nInnovation is often defined as developing a nd implementing a new idea in an applied \\nsetting, both in the general lite rature (e.g. van de Ven et al.,  1999) and in the construction \\nliterature (e.g. Sexton and Barrett, 2003a).  Th e ‘new idea’ component  embraces a range of \\ndomains.  Rogers (1983:11 emphasis added), for example, defines innova tion as “a product or \\nservice that is perceived as new by the members of  the social system” and that “it matters little ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The perceived newness of the idea for the individual dete rmines his or her reaction to \\nit.  If the idea seems new to the individual, it is  an innovation.”   The key common theme across \\nthe definitional debate in the literature is that ‘new ideas’ are taken to be the starting point for \\ninnovation.  The central question which arising from this is what is the stimulus for these ‘new \\nideas?’  There are two main schools of thought on the princi pal stimulus for innovation: the market-based \\nview and the resource-based view .  The market-based view of innovation emphasises the role of \\nmarket factors in stimulating i nnovation within companies.  From this perspective, industry \\nstructure and the competitive e nvironment are seen as the prin cipal drivers of innovation.  For \\nexample, the influences have been articulate d as customer-supplier relations (von Hippel, 1988), \\nnetwork configurations (Håkanson, 1989), market conditions (Ames and Hlavacek, 1988), and external knowledge infrastr uctures (Nelson, 1993).    \\n In contrast, the resource-based view of innovati on emphasis is that resources available to the \\nfirm, rather than on the market conditions (mar ket-based view), are the principal stimulus for \\ninnovation (Barney, 1991; Grant, 1995; Itami, 1 987).  The resource-based view of innovation \\nemphasis is that firms attempt to identify and nurture resources that enable firms to generate innovation to ‘shape’ market conditions; rather than  the market-based view within advocates that \\nmarket conditions ‘shape’ the resources whic h firms develop and exploit to response to \\nopportunities and threats.  The key proposition of this paper is that the market- and resource-\\nbased view of innovation can be ga infully linked, by extending the ar gument that there is mutual \\nadjustment between companies ‘re acting to’ market opportunities and threats and ‘proactively’ \\nidentifying, developing and exploiting resour ces and capabilities to secure a foundation for \\ninnovation in dynamic environments.  The principa l stimulus for innovation from the market-\\nbased view comes from knowledge workers’ relationships with th eir clients, a nd the principal \\nresource from the resource-ba sed view of innovati on is the knowledge wo rker.  It is the \\nproposition of this paper that the development of the optimal dynamic capabilities which bring \\nthese two resources together to co-produce innovation which creates sustainable competitive \\nadvantage.     To reiterate, it has been recognised that the knowle dge-intensive nature of services is the primary \\nway to distinguish PSFs from non-PSFs, and that  knowledge-based services  are principally the \\noutcome of the co-production of new innovation between the knowledge worker (resource-based \\nsource of innovation) and the client (market-base d source of innovation).  Further, it has been \\nemphasised that ‘new ideas’ are the starting poin t for successful innovation in PSFs.  As a \\nconsequence, innovation for PSFs should be cons idered synonymous w ith a ‘knowledge-based’ \\nview of innovation consisted of knowledge-b ased resources and capabilities.   \\n \\nThe concept of knowledge-based innovation \\n \\nDe Long and Fahey (2000) offer a synthesis of  knowledge as an ‘asse t’ and knowledge as \\na ‘process,’ and identify three distinct , but interactive, types of knowledge:  \\n \\n(1) Human knowledge constitutes what individuals know or know how to  do, and is manifested in ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Hu man knowledge is tacit knowledge.    \\n(2) Relationship/Social knowledge exists in relati onships among individuals and groups which \\nadd value to activities.  Rela tionship knowledge is largely tac it, composed of cultural norms \\nthat exist as a result of working together.  Re lationship knowledge is reflected by an ability to \\ncollaborate effectively. \\n(3) Structure/Structural knowledge is  embedded in organisational syst ems, processes, tools, rules \\nand routines.  Structure knowledge is larg ely explicit and rule based and can exist \\nindependently of staff. \\n \\nThese three types of knowledge are proposed as being critical to under standing innovation in \\nPSFs.  The argument here is that the appropria te generation of, and conversion between, human \\nknowledge, relationship knowledge, and structur e knowledge is essential to successful \\nknowledge creation and thus (particularly in  PSFs) successful innovation.  For PSFs human \\nknowledge or capital is the principal stimulus for innovation, and its management presents key \\nchallenges for successful innovation. \\n \\nKey managerial challenges for innovation \\n \\nThe human capital of a company is defined as “the sum of competence, compliance and \\ncommitment” (Rabey, 2000:23); and, as “the composition of human knowledge, skills and \\nattitude that may serve productive purposes in organizations” (Nordhaug, 1993:50).  These two \\ndefinitions are similar in stressing that human capital represents staff motivation and ability to undertake directed and productive work.  The development and use of human capital is particularly important for PSFs.  First, knowledge  workers are central to the performance of \\nPSFs.  Maister (1993), for example,  indicates that knowledge worker s’ expertise and skills, and \\ntheir ability to influen ce the client and perform their knowledg e-intensive tasks,  depends on their \\npersonal qualities.  The gene ration of ‘new ideas’ requires  the motivation and in-depth \\nknowledge and experience of knowledge worker s (Baumard, 2002), thus the capability to \\nsuccessfully innovate within PSFs is significantly located within  human capital.  Second, human \\ncapital is an important prerequi site condition for the ‘absorption’  or ‘capture’ of the value of \\nknowledge into organisationa l structure.  This view  is particularly important for small firms, as \\noften a significant proportion of their knowledge about clients a nd work activities are embodied \\nin a small number of knowledge workers.  The c oncentration of knowledge in a few staff renders \\nsmall firms especially vulnerable to key staff leaving the firm (Barrett, 1993).    \\n The co-production of professional services demand a high degree of interaction between \\nknowledge workers and clients.  Knowledge sharing and creation is  thus significantly based on \\nhuman capital held by knowledge workers and ot hers at work.  Adopting De Long and Fahey’s \\n(2000) categorisation, this knowledge can be vi ewed as ‘relationship knowledge.’  Sverlinger \\n(2000:236 emphasis added), for ex ample, argues that in PSFs  that “knowledge about market  and \\nknowledge about customers  [are] stored mostly in the heads of people .”  Knowledge located \\nwithin the knowledge worker can be viewed as ‘human knowledge.’  The implication of this is \\nthat relationship and human knowl edge are often not effectively ‘structurally’ embedded within \\nthe firm; rather, they are located within the knowledge worker.

This ‘per son specific’ knowledge held by \\nknowledge workers can be labelle d as ‘individual knowledge’ (Simon, 1957).  The accrued or \\ncumulative learning and knowledge of individuals has been re ferred as ‘individual knowledge \\ncapital’ (Neilson, 1997:1).  The challenge within PSFs is to combine various individual \\nknowledge domains to form dynamic, agile  ‘organisational knowledge’ in new configurations \\nwith feed back to, and enric h, individual knowledge (B hatt, 2002).  Organisati ons therefore need \\nto develop mechanisms for tapping into the co llective intelligence and skills of knowledge \\nworkers in order to create a greater ‘know ledge base’ (Bollinger and Smith, 2001).   The \\nargument to this point identifies two key mana gerial challenges for su ccessful innovation in \\nPSFs.  First, PSFs need to develop a context in  which knowledge conversion takes place not only \\nat the individual level (the knowledge worker and th e client), but also at the organisational level \\n(the knowledge worker and its organisation).  S econd, for this to happen, PSFs need to motivate \\ntheir knowledge workers to create and engage in this context.  These challenges were \\ninvestigated through a single case study described below. \\n \\nCase study methodology \\n \\nAn interpretative philosophy was ad opted for this research.  The rationale for this is that \\nthe authors adopt the view that innovation in PSFs cannot be reduc ed to rational cause and effect \\nrelationships; rather, it is a produc t of idiosyncratic social constr uctions.  Further, the motivation \\nof the knowledge worker requires individual inte rpretations of the consequence of specific \\nbehaviour and therefore cannot be brought together  in unconditional causal generalisations that \\nenable the researcher to predic t and control individual human actions (Rosenberg, 1994).  Within \\nthis context, a 22 month single cas e study research approach was us ed with an exploratory phase \\nand an action research phase.  The research techniques for seconda ry data collection consisted of \\na review of the relevant literat ure; and, for primary data, semi -structured interviews, company \\ndocumentation, action research ‘real  world’ activities a nd workshops.  The primary data analysis \\nresearch techniques comprised content analysis and cognitive mapping.    \\n \\nResults \\nBackground of the case study company \\n \\nThe case study company, labelled hereafter as ArchSME for confidentiality reasons, is an \\narchitectural design studio (‘practic e’) located in Manchester in th e northwest region of England.  \\nIts principal markets are the residential sector: varying from one off co mmission from domestic \\nclients to repeat business from national house builder s.

Explorative innova tion activity heavily re lied on the capacity, \\nability and motivation of ArchSME staff at an ‘ operational level’ to solve client problems and, \\nin doing so, generated short-term competitive advantage (i.e. project specific).  The outcome of this innovation focused on effective and effici ent delivery of services  to satisfy prevailing \\nexternal project needs, but were  often not embedded in the orga nisational struct ure capital due \\nto management attention and company resources being constantly focused on current or near \\nfuture project-specific considerations.    \\n(2) Exploitative innovation was viewed as innovati on which focused predominantly on internal \\norganisation and general client development activity which was not project-specific, fee \\nearning activity.  Exploitative i nnovation activity heavily relie d on the capacity, ability and \\nmotivation of ArchSME senior management at a ‘social’ level to improve organisational \\neffectiveness and efficiency to generate sustainable competitive advantage.  The distinctive feature of exploitative i nnovation (compared to explora tive innovation) was that new \\nphenomena, systems or structures were securely em bedded in the structure capital of the firm.    \\n \\nIt was found that the key distinction between successful and unsuccessful innovations was the \\n‘social’ or ‘operational’ know ledge being applied to a speci fic innovation.  Operational \\nknowledge was generated and created in operationa l interactions where the focus was on solving \\nproject-specific issues/problems.  These projects  were either ‘external’ , fee earning projects, or \\n‘internal’ but specific client-d riven projects.  Social knowle dge was generated through social \\ninteractions where the focus was on generating non-project-specific innovation which built up \\ngeneral organisational capability, and forged and replenished deeper clie nt relationship over the \\nmedium to long term.  Moreover, social knowledge  was found to have a si gnificant effect on \\nfeeding operational knowledge at a speci fic project level at a future date. \\n \\nHuman capital \\n \\nThe research results confirm the importance of human capital for successful innovation.  \\nThis is broadly consistent with the prevailing literature which notes that small businesses rely \\nheavily on human capital (Barber and Manger, 1997) .  The research findings draw attention to \\nthe importance of the company’s internal capacity, ab ility and motivation.  Th is is in accord with \\nthe literature that stresses that the internal capability to know how to discover, find, filter, gather, \\nstore, get access, and act on info rmation to optimise performance is particularly important in \\nknowledge-intensive firms (Correia and Sarmento, 2003).     For explorative innovation, the cr itical role of staff capacity , ability and motivation is \\nemphasised.  This is consistent with the litera ture on the role and ca pabilities of knowledge \\nworkers (Quinn et al., 1996).  Indeed, it was found that the nature of knowledge-intensive work \\nencouraged staff to be ‘self-motivated’ in that they are directly respons ible for the creation and \\nuse of an idea within a project- specific situation.  Th is is consistent with Maister (1993) who ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This view is \\nextended by Scarborough (1996) and Tampoe ( 1993) who identify personal growth, operational \\nautonomy and task achievement as key mo tivators to the knowledge worker.    \\n For exploitative innovation, the research findings stre ss the dominant role of senior management, \\nemployee participation in decision-making and time.   First, the role of senior management in \\nexploitative innovation involves the envisioning, creation and application of knowledge.  The \\nneed for dedicated top management support to mo tivate senior management to drive through the \\ninnovation was emphasised in explo itative innovation.  This  is in agreement w ith the literature \\non SMEs which notes the significance of the ro le of the owner-manager in small business \\n(Carter, 1996; Vyakarnam et al. , 1996).  Second, the cr itical role of seni or management in \\nproviding inspiration for providi ng the correct conditions for empl oyee participation in decision-\\nmaking was particularly pertinent in exploitative innovation.  Wit hout appropriate engagement in \\nthe decision making process, employees became  alienated from the innovation implementation \\nprocess.  Finally, the tension between the short te rm work pressure and ‘surplus’ time for move \\nblue sky experimentation was evident.  As a consequence, time was generally insufficient to \\ndedicate to exploitative innovation.  This is congruous with Chase (1997) who asserts that lack of \\ntime is the one of main barriers to knowledge transfer and innovation.   \\n \\nConclusions \\n \\nThe paper has investigated the role of senior managers in  the innovation process within \\nsmall professional service firms.   The case study results indicated  that the interaction and co-\\nproduction between the knowledge wo rker and the client within a ‘project setting’ is the \\nprincipal vehicle for managing and motivating knowledge workers.  Knowledge workers are \\nintrinsically motivated to undertak e interesting knowledge intensive work in their chosen field – \\nin the case study company’s case, to engage with  clients to produce high calibre architectural \\nsolutions on a project-to-project basis.  The res earch findings indicate th at ‘senior management \\ncommitment’ was the key for small professional  service firms to manage and motivate their \\nknowledge workers to create and engage in k nowledge development and application cycles \\nacross individual and organisation, and projec t to project boundaries.  Senior management \\ncommitment to appropriate ‘leadership’ is nece ssary to generate an inclusive, galvanising \\nstrategic vision which balances and progresses both individual a nd organisational needs within a \\nproject-based setting; and, which empowers knowledge workers to meaningful ‘participate’ in \\nthe innovation process and to delegate appropri ate ‘ownership’ and ‘accountability’ of the \\ninnovation to encourage its enduring relevance and success. \\n \\nReferences \\n \\nAlvesson, M.

Recent policies, by the \\nCentral Government, have now being adopted by local governments, some private clients, and \\nother governmental organisations to ensure that the best valu e is achieved through these new \\nprocurement initiatives. In traditional procur ement, projects are awarded individually and \\ncontractors have to submit tenders for each project  separately, which then result into formation \\nof a project based organisation or one-off supply chain where pr oject participants are taken on \\nboard for that specific project. Research shows that, in this t ype of procurement arrangement, \\nwhen projects are completed, the supply chain partners usually disper se and move to other \\nprojects immediately, without giving enough time and attentions to post project reviews. \\nTherefore, knowledge gained in the whole process is taken away  by the individuals involved in \\nthe project, and in very rare cases become pa rt of organisational knowledge for any of the \\ncompanies involved. If those individuals are move d to a different type of project then their \\nknowledge even does not get utilise on other similar projects eithe r! Since, knowledge was \\nneither captured, nor retained, nor shared, th erefore, becomes ‘rusted’ in the minds of \\nindividuals. The new innovative procurement initia tives take the above issues in account and \\nbring solutions with it. Therefor e, now the way in which work is awarded is changed from one-\\noff project to a stream of similar projects, sometimes called framework agreements. Relationship of client and contractor has now moved from  short term period to long term period with \\ncontinuous flow of similar type of projects. This has now resulted into cha nge in the structure of \\nproject team, which in traditional model, work on one project and usua lly called project-based \\norganisation, to a set of partnering organisations which would now work together with each other \\non a long term bases on several proj ects, usually called integrated supply chain. This paper will \\npresent these moves, with the help of an exam ple of three contractors from the construction \\nindustry in the North West of England, working for a local authority, ex periencing the transition \\nfrom project-based organisation to integrated supply chain. The paper will also sum up some of \\nthe key benefits of the new arrangements, one of th em is the development of an integrated supply \\nchain as a knowledge-based or ganisation, where knowledge is not  only captured, retained, and \\nshared but new knowledge is also created in form of innovative solu tions, processes, and \\nproducts. \\n \\nKeywords.

This case study is being \\ncarried out as part of a resear ch project focusing on supply chai n integration; details of the \\nresearch project could be found in othe r publications by the authors (Khalfan et al.  2004; \\nKhalfan et al.  2005a). \\n The Framework was developed by the client to  construct educational buildings in the \\nvalue ranging £500,000 to £5M. The three Constructo r Partners were appointed in December \\n2003, with an aim to retain knowledge and pass it on from one project to another over three year \\nperiod. The developers are referr ed as Contractor A, B and C in this paper. Since their \\nappointment, a few Educational Proj ects have either been complete d; some started or are in the \\nearly stages of their design. Th e authority’s vision is that the Framework partnership would \\ndeliver good quality school build ings that will lead to: Better  educational results; Greater \\ninclusion within the community; Better safety  and environmental performance; and Reduced \\ndemand on future school budgets by addressing whol e life cycle costing at  the inception of the \\nprojects.   \\nThe Framework Management Group (FMG) is  the overarching management group to \\nsteer the project towards its’ high level and corporate objectives.  It is a represen tative group that \\naddresses high level issues for the Framework. The core FMG values are: Trust; Honesty; \\nOpenness; Commitment; Co-operation; and Respect . There are also different Special Interest \\nGroups (SIG’s) within the framework. They are designed to address issu es that are impacting \\nframework and project delivery across a global basis,  i.e. impacting all or many projects within \\nthe framework.  The special interest groups cove r the following areas: IT; Contracts and admin; \\nDesign; Procurement and ma terials; and Operations. \\n  The following sections present the changes experienced and approaches adopted by all \\nthree main contractors while working with th e local authority as part of the framework \\nagreement resulting in the move from traditi onal contracting, one-off project teams to an \\ninnovative procurement (Khalfan et al.  2005c), and knowledge-based (Asad et al.  2005, Khalfan \\net al.  2005b) long-term integrated supply chain partners.  \\n \\nContractor A \\n \\nContractor A believes in th e best value procurement with their suppliers and \\nsubcontractors and has around 12 – 13 key strategi c goals for supply chain management. For the \\nbelow mentioned activity streams, Contractor  A has developed a l ong term partnering \\nrelationship with one company in the North West (NW) of England in order to provide services \\nto the local authority as part of the framework  agreement: brick layers; carpentry; plastering; \\npainting and decoration; and scaffo lding.

For other trades and products, c ontractor A goes for a list of 3 selected \\nsuppliers/subcontractor for each trade/product. But in NW region, this list of three is now \\nreduced to one for suspended ceiling and ceramic tiles as well.   Selection process. In order to select the companies, the contractor looks fo r right size company, \\nwhich can provide best value with quality labou r work. Size, shape, quality of workmanship, \\nquality of the manpower/labour, cap acity and capability of the or ganisation are also considered \\nbut price comes last. In some cases, subcontract ors are selected based on their speciality, e.g. \\nground works, etc. Usually three subcontractors and suppliers are selected for each trade and \\nproduct through PQQ process resulting into the list of preferred or ganisations and then they are \\nasked to tender for a job. Quality-price mechanism is used to select one company out of three for each trade and target price is agreed. In some cases, this relationship becomes stronger as some \\nsuppliers and subcontractors get work continu ity because of their performance and the list \\nreduces from three to only one supplier/subcon tractor. If the selected  organisation does not \\nperform repeatedly, then the list goes from one  to three again in order to bring in more \\ncompetition and best value for client.   Performance measurement.  Contractor A believes in meas uring performances, verifying the \\nperformances of subcontractors and suppliers befo re partnering with them through site visits and \\nreferences, and also measuring the performan ces while they are on site working with the \\ncontractor. They have their own key perfor mance indicators (KPIs), which are used to \\nbenchmark the performances of suppliers/subc ontractors, including: management, supervision, \\nquality, safety, commer cial attitude, etc. \\n \\nFeedback process.  All subcontractors and suppliers ar e given feedback if they were \\nunsuccessful for getting a job. This gives subc ontractors, the idea about their competency, \\ncapacity, capability, and also the knowledge about their competitor s. Also in some cases if a \\nsubcontractor has worked with main  contractor at the in itial stages of projec t and was involved in \\ngiving out prices for the job and t ook part in value engineering ex ercises etc, and later on, if dose \\nnot get selected for that job then they are given their fees for their contribution. There is always a \\nlikelihood that the company involved at initial stages for a particul ar work would get selected for \\nthat job.  Building relationship.  Contractor A believes in transparency  of information, and shares all the \\nupcoming work and start dates of the jobs with their preferred subcontract ors and suppliers. They \\nalso use the information from suppliers in th e tenders and bidding document, and also pass on \\ntheir quoted figures to their s ubcontractors/suppliers as well  with trust and confidence. \\nPartnering ethos are further reinforced through th e introduction of partnering contracts such as \\nPPC 2000 or JCT partnering contract, between the main contractor and su bcontractors/suppliers. \\n Work allocation.  Work allocation is based on the concep t that subcontractor/suppliers should \\ntake work load as much as they can deliver. The work is usually awarded in the region of 30 – 70 \\n% of subcontractors’/suppliers’ turnover. Contractor A does not go for 100% allocation. \\n  ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For the framework agreem ent with the local aut hority, the architectural \\nteam, the M & E team, and pre-cast concrete team , are all part of integrated supply chain of \\ncontractor B in providing services. There ar e three preferred subcont ractors for the ground \\nworks, used for this framework agreement. The list of preferred suppliers  and subcontractors for \\neach trade is an evolving list and new subcontra ctors get on the list as well. For the school \\nprojects as part of this framework, drawings and BOQ were sent out to  the subcontractors for \\npricing. Selection was done based on resource cap acity; value of work; lo cation of subcontractor; \\nflexible start and finish dates; price; quality; etc. Selected s ub-contractors then had a pre-order \\ninterview, which is basically the invitation to disc uss the project. Feedback is also given, most of \\nthe time verbal, to the unsuccessful subcont ractors if they appr oach the contractor. \\n Selection Process. As discussed earlier, new subcontract ors do get on to the select list. \\nContractor B looks at letter a nd broachers sent by new subcont ractors, and also contact the \\npeople for the references, and in cas e of live projects, contact the site  managers. If contractor B is \\nsatisfied then they are asked to send the quote for an upcoming job.  \\n Performance measurement. At the end of each project, a list  is produced which contains names \\nof all subcontractors. The site manger is cons ulted for his feedback on the work done by those \\nsubcontractors while they were on site. The feed back includes: quality of work; environmental \\nissues considered; progress according to the pr ogramme; safety; value for contractor/client; \\nPunctuality and Turing-up; etc. All subcontractors and traders ar e scored for above mentioned \\ncriteria from 1 till 10 as 1 being very good a nd 10 stands for poor. If the performance of a \\ncompany is well then they are given opportuni ty to price the upcoming job, or sometimes \\nnominated for the next project. If a company di d not perform then they are taken off from the \\npreferred suppliers’ / su bcontractors’ list.  \\n Work allocation. Contractor B has a specific policy for work allocation. Maximum value of a \\njob awarded to a subcontractor usually does not exceed more than 25% of their turnover.   Select list. Select list of contractor is good for both, contractor and suppliers / subcontractors. \\nGood for the contractor B because they do not have  to go out into the market and choose from \\nthousands. Good for subcontractors also because they do not have to market themselves to \\ncontractor B, and since they are on select list already, they are given opportunity to provide a \\nquotation. Once they are on the list, they are to ld about the upcoming work, and if they are \\ninterested then they can contact the contractor for the relevant documents.  \\n Getting towards fully integrated design team. On one hand, Contractor B has their own \\ninternal architectural and structural design teams,  their in house M & E (b uilding services) team \\nfor services design, and on the other hand, ha s very good relationship with their concept \\narchitect. Therefore, the design team  is actually fully integrated.   \\n \\nContractor C \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Around 3 – 4 years ago, the contractor decided to go for \\n100 % Partnering throughout their business activities. Before th at, most jobs were based on \\ntraditional contracting rather than partnering. Now around 90% of the work is done either by \\npartnering arrangements or by negotiations from the companies, which have worked with the contractor C for a long time. The current expe rience of the contractor on this framework \\nagreement is regarded as a very good learni ng opportunity by the senior management. The \\ncontractor has also worked with the local au thority before using JCT 98, where everybody on the \\nproject was struggling for the in formation from each other; probl ems related to extension of \\ntime; and increased cost for clie nt; etc. Now the contractor C ha s moved on from all the above \\nmentioned problems to a long term partne ring relationship with the authority.  \\n Learning from projects.  In the past, contractor C never finished projects on time for the \\nauthority, but working on framework has brought  improvements and now achieving completion \\ndates for the school projects. Overall relations hip and understanding with the client has also \\nimproved since the framework agreement was started. Being some sort of supply chain in place with architects on board with the contractor, most of the design brief and information from the \\nclient have managed properly. Th e learning form a school project with the client is taken and \\nreported back to the staff of the company, which re sults into organisational learning. This is then \\nused on new school projects within the framework. In some cases the learning has already been \\ntaken back to some non-framework projects done for other authorities. Contractor C also had \\ntheir regular subcontractors for example, for br ick lying, window manufac turer, etc. and had \\nbrought them along to this framework agreement.   Selection process. For electrical and mechanical contractors,  contractor C has a list of selected \\nor preferred sub-contractors. So when work comes, a competitive bidding is encouraged among \\nthose subcontractors for the best price. M & E cont ractors are the first one to become part of the \\nsupply chain. For other trades, the contractor C has started to devel op list of preferred \\nsubcontractors and suppliers. For selecting M & E for the framework agreement, the contractor \\norganised an open day and invited interested s ubcontractors. It was followed by PQQ stage, and \\ncompanies were selected and list of preferre d subcontractors was prepared, based on their \\nresponses to PQQ, references, site visits, et c. Even books and accounts were also checked in \\nsome cases! Now there is also a need to measur e these successes and benefits of working with \\npreferred M & E subcontractors before taking th e same model for selecting the other trade \\nsubcontractors.   Performance measurement.  Recently, contractor C has carrie d out client’s KPI with suppliers \\nand subcontractors for one of its school project s, as part of the framework agreement. The \\ncontractor also has their own KP Is to measure progress weekly, and also measures achievements \\nagainst specific factors for each project. A databa se is maintained and feedback is reported on \\neach subcontractor’s work in areas such as Health and Safety, Quality, Programme, etc. The subcontract or Buyers Procurement department looks into when new work comes up and sends \\ninvitation to only those who have  performed well in the past or on the current projects.  \\n Work allocation.  As part of pre qualific ation questionnaire (PQQ), all the subcontractors and \\nsuppliers are asked for the percenta ge of work they want to carry out with contractor C.

But there are othe r subcontractors as well which \\nare already involved in different other projects with different c lients/main contractors and are \\nalso part of some partnering ag reements; therefore, for them, onl y a small percentage of their \\nturnover comes from working with the contractor C.  \\n \\nConclusion and discussion \\n \\nTo date the results from the projects are s howing savings in time and cost. To maintain \\nthe momentum of these gains there must be a continuation of the posit ive attitude amongst the \\npartners in sharing their knowledge  and experiences on future proj ects, resulting in development \\nof a knowledge-based supply chains. By this appr oach further benefits will be passed onto the \\nclient and end users. Additionally, there needs to be better continuity of workload. The \\nConstructor Partners have unanimously stated that there initial subm issions were based on a \\ncertain level of turn-over with dedicated staff,  particularly in the area of management, having \\nbeen allocated to this Framework. One area whic h has caused problems to the flow of workload \\nis the protracted timescales now required for the CAPEX approvals, however now these are \\nbetter understood by all partie s, this can be programmed for. At this point however it is fair to \\nsay that there is a positive appro ach by all partners to take this  Framework forward to achieve its \\ntargets.  \\n The major benefits that are being achieve d in the following broad area by adopting the \\nstrategic partnering framework and development of integrated supply chains: Improved design; \\nLess waste and duplication; Improved delivery; Great er certainty of cost; and Better whole life \\ncycle costing. The following gives a representation of the gains in  developing integrated supply \\nchain for long-term period, which are not present in traditional “one off” projects: Savings on \\nTendering / Procurement Costs; Time Savings on Programme; Lesson learned and rolled forward \\nwithin the delivery team; Benefits of Performa nce Management Systems; Fewer Delays; Added \\nValue to the client; Knowledge  retention, capture, use, and creation; Building of Trusting \\nrelationship; etc.  \\nThe best thing about this new way of worki ng is that all three main contractors do sit \\ntogether with each other and are willing to shar e their knowledge, experiences, best practices and \\nother project related information. In  order to create and maintain this  sort of culture, the role of \\nthe client is the most criti cal (Khalfan and McDermott, 2005). In the above mentioned case \\nstudy, the client’s role is  appreciable. One could see that th e things which were even unthough in \\nconstruction are now being practiced. One of the example of these new emerging practices is the \\nmove from project based organi sation to a fully integrated s upply chain to provide long-term \\nservices to clients in a specifi c sector such as building schools,  etc. Clients, on the other hand, \\nare also making efforts for fairer procurement pro cess. The local authority mentioned in the case \\nstudy has changed the mechanism of selection for c ontractors and sub-contract ors. It used be the \\ncase that the small companies were rejected ba sed on their turnover. Now the turnover figure is \\nnot used as part of the selecti on criteria and is considered afterw ards when the percentage of the \\nwork is being allocated. Therefore, those comp anies, which were loosing out (specially the \\nSMEs) because of their small tur nover, are now able to pass thr ough the initial 2 stage selection ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In the project management literature these challenges are often defined in \\nterms of better control of timescales, budgets and resource planning. Yet these are impoverished \\nterms for conceptualising success, which is both multi-dimensional and contextual. The aim of the paper is to explore the perceptions of crit ical success factors (CSFs) in a multi-disciplinary \\nengineering practice. The findings indicate that project success is related to five dimensions of \\nwork: individuals, teams, process, project and product. Understanding th ese elements and their \\ninterdependence may enable managers to identi fy strengths and weakne sses in current work \\npractices. An important insight provided by this research is that CSFs  is a form of knowing, \\nwhich needs to be articulated and communicated more effectively within the project community. \\n \\n1. Introduction \\nConstruction organisations are facing a dramatic  shift in having to develop new approaches in \\nthe way projects are conceptualised and implemente d to deliver success. The recent interest in \\nthe intricacies of complex projec t environments and attempts to apply social science methods to \\nanalyse construction management problems conf irm this (Cicmil & Ma rshall, 2005; Bresnen, \\nGoussevskaia & Swan, 2005). Another important driver is the emergence of a more people-\\ncentred discourse around ‘team integration’, ‘t rust’ and ‘respect for pe ople’, as a means of \\nimproving work relationships and boosting performance. However,  the extent to which these \\nmethodologies deal with today’s project complex ities, the new language of positive affirmations \\nand universal urge to move ‘fro m good to great’ remains an area of conjecture. Research over the \\nlast four decades using the concept of critical  success factors (CSFs) has made an important \\ncontribution in terms of establishing what ‘mus t go right’ for a business to reach its goals (e.g. \\nDe wit, 1988; Pinto & Slevin, 1988; Cooke-Davies, 2004). But what  really constitutes project \\nsuccess? For the past 20 year or so textbooks have maintained that  there are three critical factors \\nare what define projects: a definite due date , a limited budget (includi ng personnel resources), \\nand a specified set of performance goals. Howeve r, researchers and pr actitioners alike now \\nrecognize that there are projects  where these three items are not always clearly specified \\n(Meredith & Mantel, 2006). In a ddition, there are often many implic it goals for projects, such as \\nmaking a profit, not harming the reputation of the firm, extending the organization's \\nsophistication in project management, and so on. Although the lists of succ ess factors that may \\ncontribute to successful projects now also include a variety of human, organisation and technical \\nvariables, there are many cri tics to the CSF approach (Cooke-D avis, 2004). First there are many \\ndefinitions of success, which makes it fundamentally  difficult to assess and measure any set of \\nfactors that research has come  up with. Further, empirical re search have concluded that \\nperceptions play a strong role of a project and therefore project su ccess should be termed \\n‘perceived project success’ (Baker, Murphy & Fi sher, 1988).

At the very least, success fact ors and their relative \\nimportance are idiosyncratic to the project type a nd the firm. Generalising a ‘checklist’ of factors \\nderived from one project environment to anothe r is therefore hardly worthwhile. The present \\nstudy attempts to address this issue by focusing on CSFs in a construction design context, where \\ncurrent frameworks of success factors do not s eem to apply. Second, recent findings overhaul the \\nassumption that CSFs are independent of one a nother. Due to the complexity of the project \\nimplementation process, success factors are most  likely to be dynamic, interdependent and \\nchange across time (Pinto & Pres cott, 1988). Nevertheless, relations hips between them are rarely \\nexplored in practice which rende rs them too simplistic to take account of complex construction \\nproject environments. Given the a pparent drawbacks, the need for CSFs seems to remain and this \\nhas spurred new research efforts and a reconsid eration of methodological issues (Cooke-Davies, \\n2004; Belout & Gauvreau, 2004). In this paper, the authors take the view that perceived CSFs \\ncan only be fully explored and understood in re lation to one another. By understanding the \\ninteraction between the factors could provide insights into how organisations/practitioners can \\nbest meet all their CSFs (Ang, Sum & Yeo, 2002). This highlights the need to apply a more \\ngrounded CSF approach to explore CSFs in partic ularly complex project settings. The focus of \\nthe present study is a large multidisciplinary cons truction design practice. The daily life in an \\nengineering practice is characterised by the uniqu eness and temporality of project arrangements. \\nThe challenges that the various project participants  (engineers, architects, clients, contractors) in \\ndesign projects face are many and varied. For example, there is a high degree of complexity and \\ninterconnectedness of tasks, a high dependence on  diverse skills and collective knowledge and \\nlittle time to find out where releva nt knowledge resides (Cicmil, 2004) . It is suggested that teams \\nsuch as these often have difficulty developing a shared project vision sin ce they tend to create \\ntheir own understandings of th e project reality based on their background and world view \\n(Dogherty, 1992). This paper aims to explore th e cornerstones of successful multidisciplinary \\nengineering projects. By capturi ng the perceptions of project su ccess as experienced by the team \\nmembers themselves, it is possible to make expl icit the context specific CSFs that underpin \\nconsistent project success. This may be an effective framework to better understand the \\ndynamics of project success; how different factor s reinforce or impede each other during project \\nstages. The initial findings serve as a basis fo r further investigation of CSFs and how they \\nbehave and function in actual c onstruction project setting.

There were eight  structural engineers, three \\nfaçade engineers, nine building services  engineers and two CAD-technicians.  \\n \\n2.3 Data collection  \\n2.3.1 Interviews \\nA series of semi-structured interviews we re conducted with questions focusing on the \\ninformant’s job role, experience of project work  and examples of succe ssful and less successful \\nprojects. The selected informants were e-mailed beforehand and asked to identify examples of a \\n‘successful’ and a ‘less successful’ project as the basis for discussi on in the interviews. As part \\nof the interview process, informan ts were asked to brainstorm cri tical success factors in project \\nwork. This was aimed to encourage individual s to ‘make free associations’ without being \\nprompted, about factors they perceive as critical  to project success. Th e exercise was useful \\nbecause it helped to reveal two things: 1) some of  the specific meanings that individuals attach to \\nfactors and, 2) their significance in context. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed \\nverbatim. Categories produced by the researcher were validated through workshops, where staff \\nfrom each engineering discipline including CAD- technicians, were recruited. The selected \\nindividuals were put in groups of 4-6 people according to th eir job level to allow data \\ncomparison across job levels. The informants were  asked to group all of the initial categories \\n(175) under larger categories so they would end up with a number of core categories. Each group \\nwas given 45 minutes to complete the task. Th e categorisation made by all six groups was then \\ncompared with the grounded analys is of the interview material. The analysis of the data included \\nopen coding (labelling segments of the interview material); asking questions such as ‘What is \\ngoing on here?’ and ‘What category does this incide nt indicate?’; axial co ding to link categories \\nand sub categories together, e.g. the category ‘integration of disc iplines’ was placed under the \\nlarger category ‘communication’; and selectiv e coding to generate of core categories. \\n \\n3.

The dynamics of five CSFs and their sub-categories \\n \\nFrom a managerial point of view  the project organisation need to have skilled, motivated and \\npassionate individuals to carry out the task or the challenge; these indi viduals have to work \\ntogether as a team to accomplish collaborative desi gn that satisfy the client; the individuals and \\nthe teams need appropriate technology (tools and workspace), effective project management \\n(planning, support and definition of roles and responsib ilities) to operate in a structured way; and \\nall these influence the central outcome of the project , the product  itself. The model shows that \\nproject success relies heavily on the ability a nd behaviour of team members to work well \\ntogether, but also how these relationships may be reinforced or impeded by other factors such as \\nplanning, availability of resources and style of leadershi p. Inherent in this wa y of thinking is the \\nrecursive interplay between the actors, e.g. project members, and the structure, e.g. \\norganisational hierarchy and preva iling culture, which offers some important insight into how to \\nunderstand project success. The interviews formed the basis for developing a preliminary \\nhypothesis of core CSFs, which could be mappe d onto the core categor ies created in the \\nworkshops. It is important to point out that th ese two sets of data ar e based on the open coded \\nfactors (175) elicited from the initial brainstorm ing exercise. In both instances, the primary task \\nwas to cluster the open coded CSFs into  higher level categories and label them. \\nThe initial set of high level categories, created by the researchers, comprised more detailed categories than those emerging from the workshops.  Variations were also reflected in the number \\nof core categories created, language used to label them and under which category each item \\nwould belong to. This can be explained as a consequence of time, professional group  and job \\nrole. The researchers spent an unlimited time on categorising the 175 ini tial factors into a \\nnumber of high level themes, whereas the wo rkshop participants were given limited time. \\nHowever, familiarity with the coded fact ors (e.g. ‘effective project management’, \\n‘communication between disc iplines’, ‘quality of contractor’ etc) and an  understanding what the \\nwords and sentences facilitated this task. Furthe r, interpretation of te xt and talk is often \\ninfluenced by background and professional discip line. For example: technicians created a high \\nlevel group called ‘satisfaction’ and talked about it as part of being motivated, whereas managers \\ntalked about ‘motivation’ in terms of being motiv ated by the project itself.

Associates talk ed about ‘team factors’ whereas \\nsenior engineers mentioned ‘dynamics’ which ma y not reflect a real difference between these \\ntwo groups in terms of what they are trying to articulate. Rather, it  seems that they had to make a \\nquick negotiation amongst themselves and decide what to go for. In this way, each group constructed CSFs through discus sions, debate and negotiation around the high levels categories \\nthat the CFS would fall into. Based on these observations CSFs are ta ken to be socially \\nconstructed and socially recognised phenomena. The analysis of the workshop outcomes can be \\nsummarised as follows: \\n• Project success is seen as a process rather than an end-st ate across group levels.  \\n• There is a preference to view success factors as interrelated  and mutually interdependent ; \\n‘they cannot exist without each other’. \\n• Project success is seen as dependent on apprec iating what lies beneat h the exterior of the \\nso called golden triangle, ‘cost,  time and to specification’. \\n• Success factors relating to leadership/management , team work  and competency/skills  \\nwere common to all groups. \\n• There is a high degree of consensus across groups on factors such as communication,  \\nmotivation  and culture.  Communication which is usually se en as a top success factors in \\nother studies, is not a consiste nt factor across the groups. Inst ead it was talked about as an \\noverall important factor. For example, tec hnicians talk about communication seemed to \\nbe related to being more integrated in the pr oject process. The senior engineers across all \\ndisciplines summarised it as follows: ’comm unication is the cataly st in all good project \\nwork’.  \\n• Communication is  the success factor  that influences work re lationships and acts as a \\n‘catalyst in good project work’. \\n• Variations between the groups appear to be  a consequence of job roles rather than \\nprofessional disciplines, indicati ng that junior levels (e.g. gr aduate engineers) perceive \\nsupportive as more critical than resource planni ng. Similarly, senior levels seem to place \\nmore focus on having the right people a nd manage the different and sometimes \\nconflicting project demands rather than ‘time to play with ideas’. Contrary to recent \\nstudies of CSFs in project work, client focus does not emerge as a consistent factor across \\nthe groups. There was little reference to ‘the cl ient’, ‘client satisfac tion’ or ‘end-user’  \\n The most striking observations i ndicate that project participants , regardless of background or \\nrole, hold an inward looking attitude of project  success; mainly focusing on their own concerns \\nsuch as timetables, their contribution to the pr oject and so forth. This reflects the continuous \\nregime of ‘getting things done’, or what has been  termed the ‘tyranny of projects’; a mentality \\nthat govern much of the work in the cons truction industry (Koch, 2004). One senior, male \\nbuilding services engineer expressed an  important part of this condition: ‘You just work, work, \\nwork, busy, busy, busy you know. I can organise my time but then somebody throws something \\nin…something is coming from nowhe re, which should not happen really’ . The situation is further \\ncomplicated by the difficulty in juggling the demands of being i nvolved in many projects which \\nis common in consulting engineering (Koch & Be ndixen, 2005).

It is part of a number of \\nresearch outputs regarding the social dynamics of construction team work. The study presents an \\nideal opportunity to make comparisons with ex isting success factors drawn from other project \\nsettings. Five core success factors emerged fr om the interview data: individuals, teams, \\nprocesses, project and product. Analysis of th ese factors shows that they both reinforce and \\nimpede each other in an iterative manner during the project life cycle. These findings add a \\nnumber of dimensions to the current findings in the project management literature, which go beyond the short term goals of the manager,  ‘on time, on budget a nd to specification’. \\nSpecifically, suggested model implies that human as  well as contextual f actors contribute to the \\nperception of project success. Anot her observation is that CSFs app ear to be socially constructed \\namong individuals as well as socially recognise d phenomenon. In this way, project success is \\ntaken to be a process rather than a static concep t. This way of conceptualising success is part of \\nthe new generation of research stating that proj ect organisations should be studied as social \\narrangements in terms of locating what is workin g and what is not working in them (Bresnen et \\nal, 2005; Cicmil et al, 2005). Another important obser vation in the study was that when given the \\nfreedom to state any success factor the majority of  them emphasised variables relating to internal \\ncharacteristics of the project process such as  maintaining good relationships, passion for the \\nproject, and a clear unders tanding of their role. External char acteristics of the product or service \\nitself such as customer focus or product performa nce were not emerging as critical. This pattern \\nof responses occurred in the subsequent worksh op where the participants where asked to group \\nthe success factors derived from interviews w ith engineers and CAD-t echnicians. This is \\nsurprising considering the many published articles  and books on the importance of the client in \\nproject success (e.g. Meredith et al, 2006), and br ings attention to the somewhat inward-looking \\nattitude of CSFs in project work. Assessment of these observations suggest two concurrent \\nevents: 1) engineers and technicians are more focused on getting the de sign right than focusing \\non product performance which can only be measured when the building is ready to use, and 2) the naturalised culture in cons truction seem to emphasise ‘get ting things done’ rather than \\nreflecting on what is getting done. These obser vations are to a great extent in line with \\nconclusions based on a number of different project environments and industries (e.g. Baker et al, \\n1983; Slevin & Pinto, 2004). While the pressure to deliver on time and on budget are still dominant within the project organisation, team members themselves are more interested in \\nwhether a project is worthwhile doing, satisfying and is a good learning experience (i.e. they are \\nfocused on psycho-social outcomes). The works hops demonstrate that the differences in \\nperception of project success, is  a result of job role, rather th an what professional group one \\nbelongs to. This was an expected  outcome, but worth investiga ting since professionals cultures \\nseems to be seen as major problem in multid isciplinary work (Dougherty, 1992). An important \\ninsight provided by this research  is that CSFs is a form of  knowing, which is not commonly \\narticulated within the project community. At the same time CSFs must be made explicit in an \\norganisation to have any effect on performan ce. This is reflected in the study, where \\ncommunication was singled out as be ing the ‘catalyst’ for all CSFs. The  constraint lies in the \\nnature of design work; the involvement of arch itects and other subcontra ctor that represent \\norganisations that operate outside of the engin eering consultancy. Construction project work is \\ncommunication based; efficient collaboration relies on effective diffusion of information \\nthroughout the project (Baiden, Price & Dainty, 2006, in press; Winch, 2001).

Yet there is \\nno agreement in the literature what factors ex actly contribute to succes s. Despite this, CSFs \\ncontinue to be an important method of impr oving performance in project work. The main \\nconclusions from this study are that: 1) project success appears to  be related to the opportunities \\nand constraints of organisational behaviour, exis ting work processes and structures, causing an \\ninward-looking view of success  among project participants 2) CSFs  are interrelated and \\nmutually dependant and are likely to change across time, and 3) project success is a process \\nrather than a static concept which relies on e ffective communication betw een individuals at all \\nlevels. Despite this, it is impossible to claim th at all dimensions of project success in a multi-\\ndisciplinary project environment have been captured. Further empi rical studies are needed to \\nevaluate and further develop the presented interm ediate model as basis for appropriate support to \\npractitioners in the construction industry.

For the review, 25 jour nals, 9 book publishers, and 22 international \\nconference proceedings were relied upon. No generi c landmark concepts have triggered a flow of \\nconstruction-related concepts over a 16-year period. The tem poral pattern is emerging and \\nfragmented. Overall, no applied research traditi on in business management exists as part of \\nconstruction-related management research in th e OECD countries. Nevertheless, it is claimed \\nthat this platform enables both practitioners and researchers to choose and advance their ways of \\nmanaging a business in C&E, real estate, and proj ect-based markets. Collaborative international \\nresearch is called for to advance BM concepts.  \\nIntroduction \\n \\n The background  involves the first-ever review of a population of 38 c onstruction-related \\nbusiness management (BM) concepts publis hed in English between the years 1990-2002 \\n(Huovinen 2003a). So far, the sub-results have b een introduced as part of the CIB W55 and \\nW65’s symposiums in Singapore, Toront o, and Helsinki (Huovinen 2003b, 2004a, and 2005a) \\nand as part of the 1\\nst ASCE Specialty Conference on Hi lton Head Island (Huovinen 2004b) as \\nwell as through the publicat ion channels in Finland (e.g. Huovinen 2004c).   \\n The objective  of this paper is to introduce briefl y the outcomes of both the first review \\nand the second review, i.e. the original 38 BM  concepts published between the years 1990-2002 \\nare complemented with 14 new BM concepts  published between 1 January 2003 and 31 \\nDecember 2005. This combined 52-concept platform  is promoted for both practicing business \\nmanagers and management scholars alike. The coherent nature  of managing a business has \\nbeen maintained by focusing on the research on firm s and business units that  are based in one of \\nthe OECD countries. The exception is to allow the references originating from and dealing with \\nSingapore or Hong Kong to be incl uded; due to these authors’ Br itish Commonwealth heritage \\nand interests in global businesses. Three formal p ublication channels have been relied upon, i.e. a \\npopulation of 25 journals (Table 1) and a populat ion of 9 publishers, complemented with the \\nmore subjective and random browsing of 22 av ailable conference proc eedings (Table 2).  \\n   ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The authorship consists of 42 \\n(individual, pairs or teams of) au thors. There are 72 individual au thors. 27 (52 %) concepts have \\nbeen published via journals, 14 (27 %) concepts  as part of the edited books, and 11 (21 %) \\nconcepts within the books.  \\n The cumulative publication fre quencies across the four fiel ds of construction-related \\nmanagement research  are as follows: 30 (58 %) concepts are related to construction economics \\nand management, 9 (17 %) concepts  are related to project management, 8 (15 %) concepts are \\nrelated to real estate developm ent, and 5 (10 %) concepts are re lated to industrial management. \\nNo generic landmark concepts have triggered a flow of construction-related concepts. The \\ntemporal pattern is emerging and frag mented. In this short paper, only  three contextual review \\nquestions  can be addressed as follows. \\n (1) For what industries, businesses, or sect ors are the applied BM concepts suggested? 19 \\n(37 %) concepts address construction or buildin g, 15 (29 %) project-based business, contracting \\nbusiness, complex product systems, or comb ined engineering, purchasing, and construction \\n(EPC) projects, 8 (15 %) real estate develo pment and FM services, and 5 (10 %) capital \\ninvestments-based businesses, 4 (8 %) design and consulting services, and 1 (2 %) building products supply.  (2) What degrees of business dynamism have  the authors assumed in their particular \\ncontexts? Most authors have not specified this degr ee. It is herein interpreted that each author has \\nconsidered high or at least moderate dynamism. This perception is supported by the industry or \\nbusiness contexts and the home-base contexts. The range of 54 home-base contexts includes 19 \\n(35 %) worldwide or global, 12 (22 %) UK, 10 (19 %) US, 4 (7 %) Finnish, 3 (6 %) generic, 3 (6 \\n%) Swedish, and 1 (2 %) Australian, 1 (2  %) German, and 1 (2 %) Swiss context. \\n (3) To what extent have the authors repor ted on empirical eviden ce? 27 (52 %) authors \\nhave conceptualized the management of a C& E business without pres enting readily any new \\nempirical evidence to validate their concepts . 17 (33 %) of the authors demonstrate their \\narguments or support the concepts  by presenting one or more cases (and some examples, too). \\nMost case researchers report briefly on the conduc t of their studies. 5 (1 0 %) authors present the \\nresults of the interviews. 3 (6 %) authors present the results of the mail questionnaire survey.  \\n Overall, no applied research tradition  in business management exists as part of \\nconstruction-related management resear ch in any of the OECD countries. \\nTable 1.

However, a \\nreal 16-year platform may consist of 65- 70 construction-related BM concepts. Thus, some \\nadditional literature-review efforts  are needed. In part, these 10-15 missing concepts will be \\nidentified from among the most recent books th at the nine publishers, i.e. AMA, Ashgate, \\nMcGraw-Hill, Palgrave Macmilla n, Pearson Education, Reed El sevier, Taylor & Francis Group, \\nThomas Telford, and John Wiley & Sons have p ublished between the years 2003-2005. In part, it \\nis likely that some BM concepts will be found from within the conference proceedings that have not yet been browsed. Typically, such confer ences are being organized by (inter)national \\nassociations (e.g. ASCE), institut es (e.g. Project Management Inst itute), or rese arch groups (e.g. \\nThe International Research Networ k on Organizing by Projects, IRNOP). \\nTable 2.

Sixty construction project \\nleaders who were based in the Nigerian citie s of Lagos and Abuja were selected for the \\nstudy. A questionnaire was designed to collect  data on 11 variable s pertaining to the \\nleaders including professional grouping, age, ed ucational and professi onal qualifications, \\nindustrial experience, overseas  training, overall training, pers onality, leadership style, \\nstyle range and effectiveness. De scriptive statistics were used for the analysis of the data \\nobtained. One way analysis of variance and Chi- square were used to test the hypotheses \\nset up for the study. Notable findings includ e: (1) Majority of the project leaders \\nexhibited consensus leadership style. (2)T here was no significant relationship between \\nthe project leader’s professional background an d his leadership style. (3) There was no \\nsignificant relationship between project leader’s professi onal background and \\neffectiveness. (4)There was variation in the training levels (in terms of project \\nmanagement related courses) of the different professionals engaged in  project leadership.  \\n \\nKeywords: Leadership styles, Nigerian constr uction professionals, project management, \\neffectiveness, training.    INTRODUCTION \\nBuilding process involves teamwork. Realisati on of construction projects goals requires \\nintegration of inputs from many diverse functions and disciplines.  A client or building owner \\nappoints a set of consultants – the architect who determines the form, aesthetics requirement and \\nthe likes based on the client’s brie f; the structural engineer who de signs the structure to fulfil the \\narchitect’s requirement; the building services engi neer who designs the building services systems \\n(Mechanical and Electrical) to meet the technica l specification within the space and structural \\nconstraints; the quantity surveyor who prep are estimates according to the design and the \\nbuilder/constructor responsible for the planning and execution of the c ontract to realise the \\nproject objectives. The comple xity of modern construction projects has necessitated the \\nproliferation of professionals which according to  Chan and Chan (2005), has led to increased \\nspecialisation and the emergence of a variety of new disciplines, which ha ve been added to the \\ntraditional professional structure in society. As sp ecialisation increases, the complexity of such \\nintegration grows geometrically (L iu et al., 2003). In spit of the fact that these specialists are \\nengaged under separate contract ual arrangements with the client, most of their works are ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In achieving these \\nobjectives, someone among the consultant and the build er has to coordinate the activities of these \\nparticipants on the client’s behalf  - hence a project leader. A lead er, for the purpose of this study, \\nwill be defined as a person responsible for orga nising and coordinating the work of others. The \\nproject leader is appointed to  plan, control and co-ordinate the project from inception to \\ncompletion to ensure that the client’s requirements are met and that the project is completed on schedule and within approved budget. Leadership has been highlighted as an important factor in \\nsuccessful projects in a number of studies. Hence, the leader has to change roles from being a \\ntechnical expert to a manager, then a leader and fi nally, at the end of the project, back to being a \\ntechnical expert (M äkilouko, 2004). Most consultants in Nige rian construction industry  combine \\nproject management with their pr imary responsibilities. The motiva tion for this study, therefore, \\nis to find out the profile of these different professional groups in terms of their background \\ntraining in project management re lated courses, leadership styl e and effectiveness in project \\nmanagement practice.  \\nLeadership in Construction Project \\nTurner (1993) defines a project as a complex effort to achieve a specific objective with a \\nschedule and a budget target, which t ypically cuts across organisatio nal lines; is unique, and is \\nusually non repetitive within a fi rm. A project entails the manageme nt of time and effort with a \\nview to achieving a predefined goal. The person in charge of a project may carry one of a variety \\nof titles (e.g. project leader or project manager) and is usually the main focal point of responsibility for the project (H arrison, 1992; Cooke-Davies, 1990).  \\nIn considering leadership  style in the construction industry, the unique charact eristics of the \\nindustry that can have an impact on leadership style has to be taken in to consideration. These \\naccording to Harvey and Ashworth (1993) are: (a) project characteristics, (b) contractual \\narrangement, (c) project life – cycl e and (d) environmental factors. \\nA construction project is composed of a multi tude of organisations on temporary bases. \\nIndividuals or group from severa l parent organisations are all drawn together for a short time \\nrelated task. This project-based nature of construction industry with its temporary multi-\\norganisations will almost certainly have an important influence on the managerial leadership styles of professionals working in the industry. \\nNaoum (2001, p219) states that large capital inve stment projects coupled with high complexity \\nof decision issues can require diffe rent styles of leadership, and ad mits that ‘a participative style \\nof leadership with bureaucratic or ganisation is expected to be mo re appropriate than a directive \\nstyle’. In contrast, Nicholas ( 1990) suggests that a less participat ing, more directive style might \\nbe more appropriate when there is less time and high pressure to  complete the work. Giritli and \\nOraz (2004) opined that the most effective style of  leadership depends on project circumstance, \\nespecially project duration and intensity of work done. The extensive use of sub-contracting is another f actor that can have an impact on the leadership \\nstyle of projects. Naoum (2001, p.222) suggests th at ‘the relationship between procurement \\nmethods and leadership style is the proporti on of sub-contracting against direct labour \\nemployment on project sites’. Br esnen et al. (1986) shows that task-oriented forms of leader \\nbehaviour is more appropriat e where sub-contract form the bulk of the workplace. \\nDifferent leadership styles are expected to be exhibited in different pha ses of the project life \\ncycle. During the different phases of the design process, style may need to allow for more \\ndebates, fine-tuning and deliberations. Yet, dur ing the construction phases, they may be more ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

During a concrete pour under adverse conditions for example, they may \\nneed to be tough, direct and even dictatorial. In  settling disputes, they may need to be creative \\nand conciliatory (Hopper, 1990) In sum, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate leadership style to conform to each particular situation in the development of a project. Naoum (2001 p. 223) concludes that \\n‘leadership may thus have to be switch from one  style of leadership to another or combine \\nelements of different style until the right bala nce between concerns for tasks and concern for \\npeople is reached’.   \\n \\n RESEARCH OBJECTIVES  \\nThe purpose of the study is to present a leadership  profile of Nigerian co nstruction professionals \\nwho are engaged in project team leader ship.  The objectives  of the study are: \\n1. To present the demographic characteristics of the project leaders. \\n2. To investigate if there is any association between the project leader’s profession and \\nhis leadership style; traini ng level, and effectiveness. \\n \\nRESEARCH HYPOTHESES \\nThree hypotheses were postulated for the study as follows: \\n1. There will be no significant re lationship between the leadersh ip style and the professional \\nbackground of the project leader. \\n2. There will be no variation in th e training level (in project mana gement related courses) of \\nthe different professional groups involved in project team leadership. \\n3. There will be no variation in  the effectiveness of the different professional groups \\ninvolved in project team leadership. \\n \\n \\nRESEARCH METHOD  \\nThe professionals identified and selected for the study are architect s, builders, civil engineers, \\nestate surveyors and valuers, and quantity surve yors who were involved in  building projects as \\nteam leaders.  Other professionals like mechani cal and electrical engineers, town planners and \\nland surveyors were excluded from the study becau se there was little or no evidence of their \\ninvolvement in team leadership on building proj ects.  A questionnaire was designed and used to \\ncollect data from sixty project leaders on 11 vari ables.  These project leaders were based in \\nNigerian cities of Lagos (the commercial nerve centre) and Abuja (the seat of power).  The \\nvariables studied relate to the bio-data or characteristics of the project leaders and include their age, profession, academic and professional qualifi cations, industrial experience, place and level \\nof their training, interpersonal relationship (per sonality) leadership style, style range and \\neffectiveness.

The hypothesis was \\nset up to test whether there is relationship between the leadership style of the project team leader and his professional background. Specifically it is widely believed that ar chitects are autocrats \\n(bossy). With the result of this hypothesis, it  shows that there was no  significant relationship \\nbetween the professional backgroun d of the project leader and hi s leadership styles. From the \\ncontingency table (see Table 2) ma jority of the architects (i.e. eight out of 12) are consensus \\nmanager; nine out of 11 builders are consensus managers, half (50%) of the civil engineers are \\nconsensus manages, one-third of the estate su rveyors are shareholders  managers, another one-\\nthird are autocrats while another one-third are c onsensus manager. Majority (five out of 11) of \\nthe quantity surveyors are shareholder managers. It can be observed that no single professional \\ndominates a particular leadership style. Almost  half of the quantity surveyors are shareholder \\nmanagers while most of the other professionals are consensus managers. Therefore the notion or \\nbelief that architects are autocrats is not true , as it has been established that there was no \\nsignificant relationship between le adership style and professional background of the project team \\nleader.  \\nRelationship between training level and prof essional background of  the project leader \\nThe second hypothesis was set up to find if there will be variati on in the training level of the \\ndifferent professionals involved in project team  leadership.

This is followed by builders’ group, estate \\nsurveyors’ group, architects’ group and civil engineers’ group. Th is corroborates Davis’ (1983) \\nassertion that while no one member of the design team is specifically trained towards consultant \\nproject management, the consultant quantity su rveyor is better plac ed than most others. \\n In spite of the quantity surveyors’ knowledge or training in project manage ment related courses, \\nthe consensus is that any professional can act as  a project leader. According to Graves (1982) \\nand Hammond (1983), the would-be project lead er should seek to undergo a postgraduate \\ntraining in project management in addition to hi s primary qualification or discipline. What this \\nstudy has been able to achieve is to highlight area s where each of the professionals is deficient in \\nproject management courses. Those areas are high lighted under the traini ng needs of the project \\nleaders’ section. He will then seek knowledge (add itional qualification) in those areas so that he \\nwill be better equipped for project leadership.  Relationship between effectiveness and prof essional background of the project leader .  \\nThe third hypothesis was set up to find if there woul d be variation in the leader effectiveness of \\ndifferent professionals involved in  project team leadership. Lead er effectiveness was measured \\nusing Hersey and Blanchard’s (1973) Leader Ef fectiveness and Adaptability Description (LEAD \\nself) questionnaire. The architects appeared to be most effective w ith means score of 5.0. The \\nestate surveyors with mean score of 4.58 followed this. The civil engineers scored 4.17 and came \\nthird while the quantity surveyors and the builders came forth and fi fth with mean scores of 2.67 \\nand 2.00 respectively. These variations were test ed statistically  using one-way analysis of \\nvariance. The result shows that there was no vari ation in leader effectiv eness of the professional \\ngroups involved in project lead ership. It means all the five professional gr oups are equally \\neffective which suggests that any of them can act  as project leader from leader effectiveness \\npoint of view. However, because of several challenges pose by proj ect complexity, it is advisable \\nthat those deficient in certain aspect of project management ta ke additional management courses \\nto improve their skill in project management. \\n  \\nSummary of Findings and Conclusion. \\nFrom the data analysis carried out on this st udy and from the hypotheses tested, the following \\nconclusions are made: * The modal class for industrial experience is 10 – 19 years. * Eighty percent (80%) were trained locally. * More than half (53%) have moderate training in project management course. \\n* There were more introverts than ex troverts among the project leaders.  \\n* Most of the project leaders exhibited consensus leadership style. \\n* Majority of the project leaders belonged to high task/high rela tionship (HTHR) style \\nrange. * Majority of the project leaders were highly effective. * There was no significant relationship between  the leadership styles and professional \\nbackground of project team leader s; this means that project l eader’s Leadership style has \\nnothing to do with his professional background.

Not just only on a local scale (which is often the basis for construction activities) but \\nincreasingly on a national and international scale. Howe ver, this need for ‘gloca lizing’ thinking (often \\ncombined with acting locally) in general is no practice by a large part of construction industry’s stakeholders. This paper describes an analysis of an  European situation, focussed on Dutch construction \\nindustry. In general here, leadership  is considered as the ability to bu ild up a strong construction business. \\nTwo case studies of entrepreneurs and the way they build their construction business are analysed. On the \\none hand it represents lessons learned for leadership, based on experiences in the recent past; whereas on \\nthe other hand it points at possible influencing factor s for succesful leadership, due to e.g. globalization \\nand/or a changing business culture. Results point e. g. in the direction that succesful leadership in \\nconstruction business is not just following a standard ‘format’, whereas being considered as a succesful \\nleader or not is still a part of the local (business)culture. \\n  KEYWORDS: Construction industry, Culture, Gloc alization, Leadership, Strategy.  \\n  \\n1 INTRODUCTION \\n Due to several influences, construction industry now adays increasingly needs to adapt itself towards the \\nactual situation. This is represented not only in e.g. situations in deve loping areas like e.g. former East \\nEurope, Far East, etc., but also in the areas of W est Europe. Especially, because several companies from \\nthese Western areas see their markets increasingly  changing towards the developing areas. Such \\ndevelopments seem to cause a need for ‘reset’ the mindset of those companies, to refocus themselves on a more globalizing attitude, with a local grip. This also leads to an increasing need for doing business \\n‘glocally’. This paper focusses on some examples of Dutch construc tion companies, being lead into this new ‘era’, \\nhaving different styles of leadership.

In short, the following three levels of development are being described:  \\n•\\n Industry level; \\n• Company level; \\n• Professional level. \\n 2.2 Industry Level \\n The Dutch construction industry is a dynamic business , especially during the last few years. This, because \\nthe construction industry suffered strongly due to the revaluing and restructuring actions, initiated by the \\nDutch government and large governmental clients. Th ese actions were taken specific on the market for \\nlarge public infrastructure projects, because the go vernment discovered in 2002 several companies, \\nhaving practiced collusion, by join ing themselves illegally together in te nder procedures of public projects \\n[Tijhuis, 2004]. These companies obviously had organised themselves into ‘informal groups’, acting as ‘market-cartels’. Especially in the field of infrastruct ure-projects this came out. Because of the fact that \\nDutch public infrastructure departments still are the main clients in these se ctors, these departments \\njoined themselves into a branch-wide investigation, organised by the Dutch government. This investation-\\ncommission (the so called ‘Commissie Bouwenquête’ ) has been investigating these illegal practices very \\nthorougly. Main results of  these investigations were  as follows [Vos, 2002]: \\n \\na. There is a need for increasing ‘tr ansparency’ within procedures; \\nb. Efforts on  rationalization of constr uction processes should be intensified; \\nc. Focus on the ‘right price’ instead of just focussing on the ‘lowest price’. \\n Ad a: \\n \\nMost parties in Dutch construction market are convinced that the discussion about ‘transparency’ is a \\nright one. They strive for an improvement of the si tuation as described in the investigations by the \\nCommission Vos. Especially, because this commission pointed at the fact that the group of companies, acting according illegal procedures,  was relatively small, but were  still seriously influencing the \\nfunctioning of the national tender market for infrastructure projects.  \\nAd b: \\n \\nRationalizing construction pr ocesses was and is still a key issue in Dutch construction industry. Although \\nthe present practices of e.g. buildin g teams and constructability-issues are quite state-of-the-art, there is a \\ncontinuous drive for improvement processes.  Ad c:\\n \\nAn increased focus on the right price instead on just on the lowest pri ce is still practiced widely in Dutch \\nconstruction industry. Also the (public) clients do ac cept this practice. However, until now it still seems \\nthat a sound comparison between price and quality (e.g . related to output-perform ance) is still difficult, \\ndespite the serious trend towards performance-based or output-related contracts by the public client, in \\ne.g. railinfrastructure-proj ects [Tijhuis, 2001]. \\n \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

However, in individual cases there are also \\ncompanies who’s stock-price really declined more than ca.20% within one year, basically due to the above described situation of discov ered collusion. However, although several of the companies’ stock-\\nprices recently rose again even spectacularly (more than 50% is reported recently during the last two years [Cobouw, 2006]), individual companies still suffer in the nowaday s market due to e.g. the fierce \\nprice-competition. When looking more closely to the business itself, the dynamics in the Dutch \\nconstruction market are now e.g. [Tijhuis, 2004]: \\n \\n(a) High demand for housing, due to low interest-rates and lack of houses; \\n(b) Need for impovement of procedures, due  to high rate of failure costs; \\n(c) Decreasing need for office-buildings etc., due to  the high growth of new projects finished these \\nperiods (2003-2004).  \\n Although in general the Dutch co nstruction market situation has somewhat cooled down recently \\n(especially on the offices-market) the demand for housing-projects is still high.   \\n2.4 Professional Level \\n When focussing more closely on individuals in co nstruction industry, one can see that they are \\ncontinuously being confronted with a changing environment and its regulations. Especially due to e.g. the above described circumstances in Dutch construction in dustry, regulations in tender-procedures have been \\nadapted, and e.g. the selection procedures for specif ic project-types became more difficult, or at least \\nmore complex. Parallel to that e.g. technical deve lopments have lead to new standards and norms, \\nwhereas the ongoing integration of the European Union (EU) results into a further need for harmonization (change!) of e.g. regulations. In general, several of these circumstances have influenced the career of Dutch professionals in construction industry. And not only there; due to e.g. technological developments in general, industry needs more high qualified people, combined with the providing of (low-cost?) \\nconstruction workers in industry. However, develo ping professional expertise in industry seems to \\nbecome an increasingly important item [Van der Heijden, 1998]; and not just in industry in general, but more especially also in construction industry.   3 LEADERSHIP IN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY: TWO CASE STUDIES \\n \\n3.1 Introduction \\n In general, leadership is consid ered here as the ability to build up a strong constructi on business. When \\nlooking to leadership more closely, there are opinio ns that it cannot be teached and/or learned; the \\npracticing of it could be part or not of people’s mindset, etc. Although this may be true in several cases, \\nthe way leadership is being practiced still differs . In relationship to this , Handscombe and Norman \\ncharacterize (strategic) leadership as ‘managing the missing links’. They describe that leaders need the expertise to ‘join’ or to ‘collaborate’, or just be ing able to facilitate thes e expertises [Handscombe and \\nNorman, 1993]. And several other authors on this issue are describing also factors needed for being or becoming a leader. Basic distinction between theori es are e.g. the following two description types: \\n \\n (a) An ‘outside-in’ approach; \\n (b) An ‘inside-out’ approach.

However, these publications often incorporate a way of ‘no guts, \\nno glory’ etc. An interesting recent example of this type is the publication of Baan, about his “life as an \\nentrepreneur” [Baan, 2005], and also “Winning” from Welch and Welch [Welch and Welch, 2005]. Nevertheless, one should also bear into mind that leading persons also can make mistakes. However, that \\nis no problem, as long as one learns from his or her own mistakes.  \\n \\n3.2 Analysis-structure \\n When looking more into detail,one still can see that pr actical experiences generall y personally based, and \\nmay lead to different different lessons for different people in different situations. Nevertheless it is still \\ninteresting that they can add (insight)i nformation into the interesting field of being  or becoming  a leader. \\nAnd this introduces an important discussion theme:   \\n•\\n Can someone learn to become a leader?  \\nOr: \\n• Is leadership part of someone’s character? \\n The two case-studies in this paper follow the type (a), an ‘outside-in’ approach, describing the practice of \\ntwo Dutch entrepreneurs, considered in their own s ituations as ‘leaders’ in th eir construction business. \\nThe analysis describes the way they build their co nstruction business, using the following analysis-\\nstructure:  \\n•\\n Background; \\n• Practice; \\n• Process; \\n• Results. \\n \\nAs described, it is considered here in general that l eadership is the ability to build up a strong construction \\nbusiness. The descriptions focus on analyzing pa tterns of the behaviour of these entrepreneurs. \\n 3.3 Case study 1: An Opportunistic Leader.  \\nBackground: \\nThis case-study focusses on an entrepreneur in cons truction business in The Netherlands, being succesful \\nin the growing of a private company.

Nevertheless due to the (6) ‘less opportunism’  it may reduce risks, but may also miss \\ncertain advantages, connected to expanding the bu siness-activities.

However, the audien ce may than get the impression that it’s just all about \\nusing these ‘slogans’ as a kind of tools and/or guarantee for being or becoming a good leader…?! And \\nthat seems to be qu ite often a mistake…! \\n Nevertheless, an interesting thing in respect of this  discussion is e.g. the viewpoint of Rothschild, in \\nwhich he distinguishes four types of strategic leaders [Rotschild, 1993]:  (1) Risktakers , (2) Caretakers , (3) Surgeons and (4)  Undertakers .  \\nThese represent four phases of growth until decline of an enterp rise, being e.g. (1) developing new \\nbusiness , (2) systematic growth , (3) restructuring  and (4) closing/liquidation .  \\nThis indicates that leadership has to do with several essential phases of an organization’s lifecycle, and it \\ntherefore should be more than just ‘slogan manage ment’. It also indicates that the key-elements of \\nleadership may be different for each individual and/or  organization, due to different environments, clients, \\nproducts, timing, phases, etc. \\n When adding these insights to the analyzed situatio n within the Dutch case-studies (as part of West \\nEuropean business culture), one can see that in fact three main factors are important for probably becoming or being a good leader. These main-factors obviously are: \\n \\n•\\n a good timing (=also feeling) for the market (= enviroment); \\n• a good feeling for choosing the right  people (=employees, clients etc.); \\n• a focus on the core business (=core competen ces), balanced with an opportunistic approach \\n(=taking chances). \\n However, learning from the past does not mean that these factors cannot change. Also in Dutch (and West European?) industry probably they may change, influenced by e.g. the globalization  (which is often on a \\nlocal scale -‘glocalization’- in construction business) and/or a changing business culture . This also means \\nthat ‘positive’ influences on leadership in the one situation can also be  ‘negative’ influences  on leadership \\nin the other situation. Comparable to this may be  more or less the statement, made by the early \\nmathematician Blaise Pascal, who said: ‘Vérité en-deça des Pyrenées, erreur au-delà’ , being translated by \\nHofstede in his research on business cultures, as [in: Hofstede, 1980]: ‘ There are thruths on this side of \\nthe Pyrenees, which are falsehoods on the other side’ . \\n \\n 4 CONCLUSIONS  4.1 Conclusions \\n \\nRegarding the direction of the results, the following conclusions are described:  \\n1. Succesful leadership in construction business is not just following a standard ‘format’. It can be \\nreached by several approaches. This means that ‘positive’ influences on leadership in the one \\nsituation can also be ‘negative’ influen ces on leadership in the other situation. \\n \\n2. Because also construction business is a people’s business, succesful leadersh ip has to do with \\nhaving the right people available within th e networks one works within. However, it needs a \\nvision how to do this in the most suitable way. \\n ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Having a right ‘timing’ is considered to be  an essential need for being a succesful leader. \\nHowever, ‘timing’ without ‘action’ does not ma ke a business. And in practice, ‘action’ means an \\nentrepreneurial need for focus on the goal(s) set. \\n \\n4. Although diversifying businesses may be a good stra tegy for spreading risk, it can also weaking \\nits market strenght.

Being a succesful leader in construction business (o r even in general), depends strongly on what \\none sees as ‘indicators for being succesful’. And this often differs between regions and \\n(business)cultures. This means that the way of be ing considered as a succesful leader or not is \\nstill a part of the local (business)culture. \\n   \\n5 REFERENCES \\n Baan J.

Yet, there is no \\nconsensus on a single framework that can be used  for analyzing international competitiveness. \\nThe aim of this paper is to discuss the app licability of Porter’s diamond framework and its \\nvariations to the constr uction industry and propose an agenda for further research. It is argued \\nthat the focus of research should be on interrelations between dete rminants rather than discussing \\nthe determinants in isolation. Fu rthermore, rather than single -country assessments, researchers \\nmay be involved in a  collaborative work to  investigate cases from all over the world and \\nconstruct a construction-specific framework to investigate international competitiveness.  \\nIntroduction \\nInternational construction is a subject which receives atten tion of many researchers. The \\npatterns of international trade, level of attrac tiveness of specific markets, competitiveness of \\ncompanies from different countries in the global construction market, future trends, risks specific \\nto international construction and the critical su ccess factors for manage ment of international \\nconstruction projects are among th e most popular research topics . The aim of Table 1 is to \\nsummarise some of the topics that are wide ly covered under the heading of international \\nconstruction. Three categories are defined accordi ng to type of research. According to Table 1, \\nthe term “competitive advantage”, which is the fo cal point of the current study, falls under Group \\n1. As research on international c onstruction business is mainly de rived from general international \\nbusiness theory, researchers try to adapt the definition of competitive advantage to the construction industry. Required sources of comp etitive advantage are defined and usually, \\nconceptual frameworks are utilised to explain ho w competitive advantage is achieved in a given \\ninternational market. General theories, such as  Porter’s (1990) and Dunning’s (2000) work, are \\napplied to elucidate the competitive success of companies working in international markets. \\nUsually, companies from differe nt countries are compared a nd strategies are proposed to \\nachieve/sustain competitive advantage in cert ain markets. Finally, Table 1 is by no means \\ncomprehensive and the grouping system depicted in Table 1 should not be considered as a \\ngeneral categorisation which is accepted by all researchers and applicable to all cases.   \\nThe aim of this paper is to concentrate on “conceptual frameworks” that are used to \\nmeasure the level of international competitiven ess and discuss their applicability to the \\nconstruction industry.

The term “comparative advantage” is used to \\ndescribe differences in national efficiency and factor endowments, howev er whether comparative \\nadvantage is turned into an actual competitive ad vantage depends on many other factors. Porter \\n(1998) explained the impact of national condi tions upon firms’ international success from a \\nwider perspective and argued that  the major impact of the na tional environment upon a firm’s \\nlevel of competitive advantage is  not related with the resources available within the country so \\nmuch, rather, it is related with the dynamic cond itions that shape the firm’s identity, critical \\nmanagerial behaviour a nd innovative capability.  Many resear chers proposed to use conceptual \\nand analytical frameworks to investigate “national competitive advantage” for international construction. For example, Ofori (1994) used Po rter’s diamond framework to guide formulation \\nof a program for developing Singapore’s construc tion industry. Similarly, Oz  (2001) investigated \\nthe sources of competitive advantage of Turkis h contractors in international markets by using \\nPorter’s diamond model.

Also, some authors have \\nmodelled international construc tion without particular refere nce to existing theoretical \\nframeworks. For example, Momaya and Se lby (1998) quantified the international \\ncompetitiveness of the Canadian construction indus try using a model that has three components: \\ncompetitive assets, competitive processes a nd competitive performance. Although, existing \\nframeworks developed for analysing internati onal competitiveness have been adapted to the \\nconstruction industry, none of the frameworks is  found fully capable of reflecting realities of \\nconstruction, as discussed by Oz (2001) and Ofori (2003).

In \\nthis paper, criticisms of Port er’s diamond model will be discusse d as well as other frameworks \\nproposed by different researchers as an extension to the original diamond. \\n \\nPorter’s diamond framework \\n \\nThe major idea behind Porter’s diamond framewor k is that nations su cceed in industries \\nwhere their home base advantages are valuable in other nations. The main question is “Why does \\na nation achieve international success in a particul ar industry ?”.  Accordin g to Porter (1998), the \\nanswer lies in four broad attributes of a nati on that shape the environment in which local firms \\ncompete which are called as “determinant s of national competitive advantage”: \\n 1. Factor conditions: Factors of pr oduction such as skil led labor, infrastructu re, etc necessary to \\nsucceed in a given industry. 2. Demand conditions: Nature of home demand for the industry’s pr oduct or service. \\n3. Related and supporting industries: The presence  or absence in the nation of supplier and \\nrelated industries those are internationally competitive. 4. Firm strategy, structure, and rivalry: The conditions in the nation governing how companies \\nare created, organized and managed a nd the nature of domestic rivalry. \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.

The effect of one \\ndeterminant is contingent on the state of others. A dvantages in one determinant can also create or \\nupgrade advantages in others. Two additional vari ables can influence the national system: chance \\nand government. Chance events are outside the control of firms and even government. Diamond \\nframework gives firms an insight into how to se t strategy in order to become more effective \\nagainst international competitors. Porter stat es that the underlying issues of the diamond \\nframework are broader than the role of nations. Wh at is really explored is “the way in which a \\nfirm’s proximate environment shapes its competitive advantage over time”. Much is known about what competitive advantage is  and how particular actions crea te or destroy it. Much less is \\nknown about why a company makes good choices inst ead of bad choices in seeking basis for \\ncompetitive advantage. Porter’s diamond framework aims to answer why firms from particular \\nnations choose better stra tegies than those from others for co mpeting in particul ar industries. Of \\ncourse, all firms may not exploit national envi ronment equally well thus, not all firms will \\nachieve competitive advantage internationally. In Porter’s study, ten nations have been selected \\nand the industries in which the nation’s firms are internationally successful were identified. During the 4-year study, focus was on gaining and sustaining competitive advantage in relatively \\nsophisticated industries. Unit of analysis was indu stry or distinct segment within an industry. The \\ninternational success was defined as possessing competitive advantage relative to the best \\nworldwide competitors. However, Porter is no t free from criticism. Criticisms and how new \\nmodels are developed to overcome its shortcom ings are discussed in the next section.  \\n \\nGeneral criticisms and variations of Porter’s di amond framework \\n Criticism 1. The diamond framework does not de al with multinational activity properly:  \\nDunning (1993) claims that the importance of mu ltinational enterprises is underestimated in the \\ndiamond framework. Strategies are products of a learning process, thus, companies learn from \\ntheir international activities as well as th eir home market conditions. To eliminate this \\nshortcoming, the multi-national activity is defined as the 3\\nrd exogenous variable and Dunning-\\nPorter framework is formulated. Similarly, a \"Generalized Double Diamond Model\" has been \\nproposed by Moon et al. (1998) to  incorporate global activity into  the framework. The major idea \\nis to formulate a  generalized double diamond mode l which will fit all countries. The inner-most \\ndiamond in this framework is identical to Port er’s original diamond. The outer-most diamond is \\nalso identical in terms of the determinants but it represents the gl obal context. The dotted \\ndiamond in between is the result of the nationa l diamond as well as multi- national activities. The \\napplicability of the model to the constructi on industry has been tested on Korean and \\nSingaporean cases. It may be applicable to globa l construction industry as competitive advantage \\nin international markets is mainly due to “deter minants of international advantage” rather than \\n“national sources of competitive advantage”. For in stance, joint venturing is a widely utilized \\nstrategy by contractors doing work in the intern ational markets. Thus, contractors learn from \\ntheir foreign partners as well as the market conditions prevailing in the host country. These \\nexperiences are embedded in their “Structure, st rategy and rivalry”. Consequently, \"Generalized \\nDouble Diamond Model\" is more applicable for companies operating in international markets \\nthan Porter’s original diamond framework.   Criticism 2.Role of human fact ors should be emphasized more: It is claimed that as human \\nfactors manage the physical factors to increa se and sustain international competitiveness,   human ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Cho (1994) proposed \\nan extended diamond model by incor porating the role of human fact ors. This framework includes \\nfour groups of human factors in  addition to the four physical factors of the original diamond \\nmodel in explaining a nation's competitiveness. Human factors include wo rkers, politicians and \\nbureaucrats, entrepreneurs, a nd professionals. Physical fact ors include endowed resources, \\ndomestic demand, related and supporting industries,  and business context. Chance, an external \\nfactor, is added to these eight in ternal factors to make a new pa radigm. This model has not been \\napplied to the construction industr y. In labor-intensive construction works, low cost of labor is a \\nmajor source of competitive advantage. The extende d diamond model that takes into account of \\nthe productivity and cost of labor may bette r explain the differences between competitive \\npositions of construction companies from different nations.   Criticism 3. Role of governme nt should be emphasized more:  Stopford and Strange (1991) \\nnoted the important role of government. The competitiveness triangle proposed by Lall (2001) \\nputs government policy in the centre of the action, whereas government is an exogenous factor in \\nthe original diamond. The competitiveness triangle  has three determinants which are incentive \\nmarkets (nation’s macroeconomic management, trad e policies, characteristics of the industry and \\nhome demand), factor markets and institutional markets (bodi es that support technological \\nactivities and development). Ho wever, this model has not be en tested on the construction \\nindustry. The competitiveness triangle may be ap plicable to the construction industry as the \\ngovernment may significantly affect the indus try’s success in international markets. \\n \\nCriticism 4. As well as the four determinants  in Porter’s diamond, culture, institutional \\narrangements and government should be incorpor ated into the framework so that it can be \\napplicable to the construc tion industry (Ofori, 2003):  In the light of these suggestions, \\nEricsson et al. (2005) proposed the hexagon fram ework, which is an extension of Porter’s \\ndiamond framework. In this framework, factor conditi ons are split into two determinants such as \\nHuman Resources and Factor conditions (similar to nine factor model) in order to highlight the \\nlabor intensive characteristic of the construc tion industry. Demand conditions are kept the same \\nbut related and supporting i ndustries are left out. Porter’s Firm  strategy, structure and rivalry is \\nalso split into two determinants which are Fi rm strategies, management and organization and \\nIndustry characteristics. Firm strategies, manage ment and organization is about firm specific \\npractices whereas Industry characteristics is about competition and collaboration in the \\nconstruction industry. As government is also a major client and market intervener in the \\nconstruction industry, it is consid ered as a determinant of its own, not an exogenous factor. The \\ntwo exogenous factors in the hexagon framework ar e chance and culture wh ich influence the six \\ndeterminants of the framework. The inner hexagon reflects the domestic construction \\ncompetitiveness whereas the outer hexagon reflects the international dimension that poses opportunities and threats to the domestic construc tion industry. Similar to the generalized double \\ndiamond framework, hexagon framework incorporates the international activ ity into the model. \\nThis model is specifically developed for the cons truction industry, however there are no reported \\napplications of the hexagon framework yet.   \\nCriticism 5. Links between different countries  shall be incorporated into the diamond \\nframework:  Dunning (1993) argues that for EU member s, national diamonds may be replaced \\nby supranational ones. Rugman and d’Cruz (1993)  suggest that the Canadian diamond should be \\nconsidered jointly with the USA, as a North American diamond.

Figure 2 \\ndemonstrates the unknowns associated with the varia tions of Porter’s model. In order to design a \\nframework applicable to international constr uction, the “determinants” , “exogenous variables”, \\n“interrelations between variable s and exogenous factors” and “number and structure of layers” \\nhave to be decided. The shape of the model (diamond, hexagon et c.) is dependent on the number \\nof determinants and the links between them. \\n \\n \\nFigure 2. Unknowns in a framework for an alyzing international competitiveness  \\n \\n1. About the determinants and exogenous factors:  As explained in the previous part, some of the \\nresearchers (e.g. Ericsson et al. 2005, Ofori 2003) argue that government should be a determinant \\nof its own. However, this is against the philosop hy of diamond framew ork. There is no doubt \\nthat government has a significant role in the construction indust ry, however, the reason why it is \\nnot a determinant in the origin al diamond is not underestimati on of its importance. Exogenous \\nfactors may be as important as or more important than the determinants, however they are not defined as such because their major impact is on the determinants rather than national \\ncompetitive advantage.

Due to its indirect impact on national \\ncompetitive advantage, we argue that it should  be considered as an exogenous variable. \\nSimilarly, culture factors work through the dete rminants and have considerable impacts on the \\nlevel of national competitive advantage. Thus, we  propose that culture should be incorporated \\ninto the model as an exogenous factor influencin g the determinants. We also propose that rather \\nthan increasing the number of de terminants, each determinant in the original diamond should be \\ndivided into sub-groups that refl ect the realities of the constr uction sector. For example, as \\nconstruction industry has got va rious sub-markets having differe nt characteristics, demand \\nconditions should be considered separately for each sub-sector . The housing sector is very \\ndifferent from the infrastructure market due to existence of different clients, complexity of \\nprojects and required skills to gain compe titive advantage. Similarly, under firm strategy, \\nstructure and rivalry, project leve l activities/capabilities should be differentiated from those at \\nthe corporate level.   2. About the relationships between factors : The factors in the diam ond framework are mutually \\ndependent, thus effect of one variable depends on the state of others. This feature of the \\nframework makes it useful for analyzing the dynamics of national competitive advantage, \\nunderstanding the “past competitive advantage” and predicting future industry evolution by \\ncreating scenarios about changes in different factors. However,  in many studies (e.g. Ofori, \\n2003), determinants are classified as either strength or weakness factors isolated from each other \\nand the essence of the dynamics between determin ants is missed. We argue that as well as the \\nnumber of determinants, relationships between  determinants have to be discussed by the \\nresearchers.  \\n 3.About the layers : Although the home-market factors have the major role on competitive \\nadvantage of a nation, industry or a firm, it is cl ear that firm structure, strategy and rivalry, \\ndemand conditions, related and supporting industries and factor conditions are affected from the \\nglobal market conditions. For example, as a resu lt of international expe rience, companies may \\ngain new skills such as dealing with bureaucr acy, management of polit ical risk (valid for \\ncompanies from advanced industrialized countrie s carrying out projects in developing or less \\ndeveloped countries) or developing efficient quality assurance systems, management of \\nenvironmental risks (valid for companies from de veloping countries worki ng with partners from \\nadvanced industrialized countries) which are not required in their home market. Some of these \\nnewly acquired skills may have an impact on the home-market demand conditions, change the rules of competition and affect even the requi red human resources (factor conditions). One can \\nargue that, especially for developing and underd eveloped countries, international construction \\nexperience of contractors may result in drama tic transformations in home-market conditions \\nleading to higher competitive advantage internati onally in the long run.  Thus, learning as a \\nresult of international activity should be incorporated into th e model by adding another layer to \\nthe diamond.  \\nConclusion \\n \\nIt is clear that proposing a framework for an alyzing national competitive advantage in the \\nglobal construction industry is a challenging task. Due to its project-based nature, establishment \\nof joint ventures by firms having different natio nalities and utilization of  focus strategies by \\ncontractors rather than a global diversification strategy, it is di fficult to define terms such as ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This focus has signific ant relevance to the cons truction industry where \\nproduction-related research has predominantl y overshadowed organizational development \\nresearch.  As one effort to change this emphasis,  the authors present a research effort designed to \\nstudy current organization learning techniques and technologies fielded by organizations both \\ninside and outside of the constr uction industry.  Through a series of exploratory case studies, the \\nauthors developed a maturity model together with the Construction I ndustry Institute that \\nprovides construction organizations  with a framework for develo ping a learning organization \\nculture.  The maturity model focuses on learni ng organization characteri stics of leadership, \\nprocesses and infrastructure, communication/collaboration, e ducation and culture at the \\norganization, community and indivi dual levels.  This paper introduces  the results of that effort \\nincluding a presentation of the learning organization maturity m odel, framework application, and \\nthe overall characteristics of a learning organization. \\nIntroduction \\nThe construction industry of the 21st century is undergoing signifi cant changes as it addresses \\nissues such as the aging of the construction work force, globalization, growth of the organization, \\nand “better” client solutions.  These changes ar e initiating a looming crisis for the construction \\nindustry, the need to both re tain knowledge within the orga nization and focu s on continuous \\nhuman resource development thro ughout all levels of the organi zation.  Specific ally, it is \\nimperative for construction, engineering an d owner organizations to evolve into learning \\norganizations  where continuous knowledge enhancement and improvement of processes \\nbecomes a fundamental element of the construction business. \\n Although the concept of learning organi zations may be new to construction \\norganizations, the concept is well-established in  the management domain.  The foundation of the \\nconcept is rooted in work conducted by Peter Se nge in the organizational systems domain (Senge \\n1990a).  In this work, Senge emphasizes that orga nizations must focus less on day-to-day events \\nand more on the underlying trends and forces of ch ange that cause day-to-day events to occur.  \\nFrom this analysis, organizations can focus on le arning new ways to address issues and adapting ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This concept adopts the idea that both generative and adaptive \\nlearning must occur in a learni ng organization.  Sp ecifically, generative learning focuses on an \\norganization creating new knowledge, while adap tive learning focuses on how an organization \\nchanges processes to adapt to changing enviro nments (Senge 1990b; Garvin 1993).  Reflecting \\nthe need to move in this proact ive, adaptive direction, the author s and the CII research team put \\nforward the following learning organization defin ition based on work by others and a focus on \\nthe needs of the constructi on industry (Leadership 2006). \\n \\nA learning organization is skilled at creating, acquiring, sharing, and applying \\nknowledge, embracing change and innovation at all levels resulting in optimum \\nperformance and maximum competitive advantage. \\n \\nResearch Methodology \\nGiven the potential benefits of moving to a learning organization, th e authors focused on \\nboth the history and current th inking on learning organizations both within and outside the \\nengineer-procure-construct (EPC ) industry.  These perspectives were obtained through a \\nmethodology that emphasized both th e analysis of existing research  and the development of new \\nknowledge based on the resear ch findings.  The primary st eps in the methodology were \\n1) Literature Review, 2) Survey, 3) Case St udies, 4) Maturity Model Development, and \\n5) Validation.  Additionally, the research team developed an automated assessment tool – Le\\narning O rganization R apid D iagno stic (LEONARDO) – to assist in the assessment and \\nimplementation of the learning organization. \\nThe literature review focused extensively on lear ning from prior research in related fields.  \\nSpecifically, work by Peter Senge, Peter Drucker a nd others was analyzed to determine how the \\nmanagement community has introduced learning con cepts into corporate culture.  The results of \\nthis analysis provided the foundation for both the survey and the learning  organization maturity \\nmodel presented in this paper. \\nThe next step was to survey CII member co mpanies to determine where the membership \\ncurrently stands in terms of achieving a learning organization culture was a primary objective of \\nthis research.  The CII membership is comprise d the EPC industry leaders.  Membership includes \\nboth public and private owners, engineers, and cont ractors.  To achieve this objective, the CII \\nmembership was surveyed on topics relating  to lessons-learned, knowledge management, \\nlearning, and organization commitment to devel oping a learning culture. Thirty-five of the \\nmember companies responded to the survey, givi ng the project team a solid understanding of \\ncurrent learning organization implementation within CII. \\nThe results of the survey illustrated that EP C organizations were in  the early development \\nstage of establishing learning organizations. Therefore a cas e study approach was determined to \\nbe an appropriate method for collecting data an d developing the maturity model.  Based upon the \\nliterature review and the survey findings, a case study protocol was deve loped and administered \\nto ten organizations.    The case studies invo lved organizations both inside and outside the \\nconstruction industry that had been documented as  pursuing a learning culture.  The case studies \\nfocused on gaining an understanding of what was required to establish a learning organization \\nculture.  \\nThe results of the case study effort led directly to the development of a learning organization \\nmaturity model.  The maturity model presents organizations with a path forward for achieving a \\nlearning organization culture.

The researchers applied \\nthis maturity model to an automated assessm ent tool, LEONARDO, which also has decision \\nsupport functionality.  While an explanation of the development and testing of this tool is beyond \\nthe scope of this paper, the model itself is expl ained in detail in the sections that follow. \\nThe final step in the research  methodology was to validate the maturity model with specific \\norganizations and additionally to determine barriers to successfully implementing a learning organization.  Validation was done in a two step  process.  The first step involved eight \\ncompanies answering questions about each cell of  the maturity model.  The research team \\nassessed each company on the maturity model.  These results were then discussed with the company to determine their accuracy.  The second step of the validation was to conduct a second \\nset of in depth case studies with three additiona l companies using the maturity model framework \\nto identify barriers to achieving a learning organization. \\nThe Learning Organization Maturity Model \\nThe primary outcome of this research is a lear ning organization maturity  model.  The drivers \\nmotivating an organization to adopt such a l earning organization culture were previously \\ndiscussed.  As the next level of detail, the components of the learni ng organization maturity \\nmodel are presented.  These components provide the foundation for an organization to move toward a learning organization through a series of planned activities that result in the maturing of \\nthe learning organization culture.  Figure 1 is a matrix that illustrates the maturity model for \\nlearning organizations as devel oped through this research.  Th e learning organization entities \\nform the horizontal axis of the matrix and th e learning organization characteristics form the \\nvertical axis of the matrix.  As  an organization matures, it moves from the top right corner of the \\nmatrix to the bottom left corner – ultimatel y achieving a learning organization culture as \\nexplained in the following sections.  \\nLearning Organization Entities \\nThe entities of learning across th e top of the maturity model pr ovide a reference point to the \\nprimary learning groups found within an organiza tion.  Each of these groups is dependent on \\neach other to facilitate the exchange, de velopment, and evaluation of knowledge. \\n• Organization – The organization is the overall corporate entity including all levels of \\nmanagement and staff personnel.  The organi zation is a critical part of the learning \\norganization concept since a learning organization cannot exist without the \\nencouragement and endorsement of top executives as well as the buy-in from staff personnel throughout the organization.

Attributes include: \\no Facilitating the exchange a nd management of knowledge: \\no Institutionalizing new knowledge  through new processes: and \\no Transferring a resource commitment  from executive management to \\nimplementation plans and proper organization design. \\n• Communication – The interaction between both COPs and individuals within the \\norganization that facilitates the free sharing of  knowledge at all times and at all levels.  \\nAttributes include: \\no The sharing of knowledge in pursu it of organization improvement; \\no Supporting the establishment a nd continuation of COPs; and \\no Eliminating of barriers to communication. \\n• Education – A commitment by both management  and employees to continuous education \\nopportunities is a foundation of th e learning organization concep t and the key to bringing \\nnew knowledge into the organiza tion.  Attributes include: \\no Seeing education as a value to both the individual and the organization;  \\no Developing a systematic approach to  obtaining education and disseminating \\nknowledge; and \\no Developing a structured appro ach to promoting education. \\n• Culture – The final characteristic of lear ning organizations is the development of a \\nculture that supports, promotes, and rewards learning as a vital part of organization \\nenhancement.

Specifically, each characteristic of a lear ning organization can be \\napplied to a specific entity of learning through re sponsibilities and actions that are required at \\nthat level.  In contrast to job responsibilities, these respons ibilities and act ions are overall \\nrequirements that are placed on each member of the organization in an effort to establish a \\nlearning organization culture.  The requirements underlie specifi c project responsibilities to \\noutline the expectations that a learning organization is placing on each employee. \\nFor example, when the Leadership characterist ic is applied to the Organization learning \\nentity, several responsibilities are de fined for the organization as follows; \\n• Sets vision – responsible for setting a shared vision of learning that each member of the \\norganization can adopt and follow. \\n• Creates proactive learning environment – esta blishes the environment that promotes the \\nsharing, seeking, and adopting of knowledge. \\n• Empowers learning at all levels – promotes  learning throughout th e organization through \\nresource commitment and reward. \\n• Allows/Encourages risk – creates an e nvironment where risk taking is not only \\nacceptable, but encouraged when manage d properly and is focused on enhanced \\nperformance. \\n• Builds culture – responsible for establishing the underlying culture  that places learning as \\na foundational element of the organization practice. \\n Similar responsibilities are defined for each cell in the matrix and provide guidelines for the \\norganization to set expectations for each member  of the organization as the move toward a \\nlearning organization is ach ieved (Leadership 2006). \\nThe development of a learning organization does not  occur overnight or ev en in a single year.  \\nRather, this research effort discovered that the development of a full learning organization \\nculture requires a series of steps that often takes at least five years or more to complete.  With this level of effort facing an organization, a stru cture is required to assi st in determining the \\nappropriate actions to take at each  stage of the process.  To assi st in this process, the matrix \\ndescribed above can be used to monitor the de velopment of a learning organization throughout \\nthe process.  This monitoring is referred to as a maturity model and it evaluates where an organization is during the process fro m first started through the mature stage.  In this final stage, \\nthe organization is transformed into a learning or ganization complete with an associated learning \\nculture. \\nApplication of the Maturity Model \\nThe evolution to a learning organiza tion is defined in this research as a five-level approach with \\neach level representing a stage of development towa rds a mature learning organization concept.  \\nEach level is defined as an organization ha ving completed the implementation of specific \\nconcepts..  The learning organi zation maturity levels are descri bed in Figure 2 below.

This progression reflects the need for an organization to initially have i ndividuals who are going to take th e leadership of the learning \\norganization and champion the cause within the orga nization.  Once the leadership is established, \\nprocess can be developed, communication enhan ced, education programs introduced, and finally, \\na culture established.  The failure to follow this  path could lead an organization to expend \\nsignificant resources without pu tting in place the foundation required for the learning \\norganization.  The following descriptions provide an  overview of the five ma turity levels and the \\nassociated matrix levels that must be achieved. Level 0:  At Level 0 it is assumed th at the organization is just be ginning the transformation to a \\nlearning organization concept.  It is thus considered the base laye r where all organizations begin.  \\nAlthough some activity may be occu rring in individual ma turity cells, the transition to a Level 1 \\norganization is still occurring. Level 1:  A Level 1 learning organization is focused on establishing the leadership required to \\nmove the organization toward a le arning organization co ncept.  The idea that leadership is \\nrequired to move the organization forward, starting from an individu al level is represented by the \\nmatrix completion evaluations.  Additionally at this level, the organization will begin addressing the processes and infrastructure that will be  required to implement the knowledge sharing \\nconcept that is a key compone nt of a learning organization. \\nLevel 2:  A Level 2 organization has completed the leadership transformation as well as the \\nindividual and community levels of process and infrastructure development.  Additionally, the \\nLevel 2 organization is actively addressing the communication aspe cts of learning and the initial \\nstages of education and culture change at the indi vidual and community levels .  At this stage, the \\norganization is actively moving toward and su pporting a new focus on knowledge sharing and \\nopen communication. Level 3:  A Level 3 organization is di stinguished by its full implement ation of organization-wide \\nprocesses to support learning as well as a new fo cus on the learning cultur e at the individual and \\ncommunity levels.  Learning is no longer viewed  as a necessary human resources requirement, \\nbut is viewed as an integral part of an indi vidual’s job and career.

Following these interviews, interviews  were conducted with management and project \\nmanagement personnel within each company.  The inte nt of these interviews was to determine if \\ninitiatives conceived at the company’s executive le vel were being translated to the project level \\neffectively.   \\n Prior to answering any questions relating to  learning organizations , participants were \\nasked to briefly describe thei r role in the company and prov ide any background information to \\nthe company that they thought may be helpful.   The learning organi zation questions were \\ndeveloped based on the learning or ganization characteristics and levels defined by the learning \\norganization maturity model.  Participants were first asked how familiar they were with the concept of a learning organization and, if they we re at all familiar with the concept, how they \\nwould describe a learning orga nization.  Following this, questi ons became more specific and ', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Of particular significance from these st udies is the finding that executive support is the \\nkey first step to a successful implementation of a learning organization cu lture.  Similar to all \\nchange management efforts, this  support is critical to both the allocation of resources and the \\ncontinued support of the objective ov er an extended period of time. \\n \\nConclusion \\nOrganizations as diverse as Motorola and Acce nture have transformed learning organizations \\nfrom a concept to an integral component of their business success.  Researchers such as Peter Senge at MIT have written extensively of the bene fits and challenges associated with adopting a \\nlearning organization culture.  However, the existence of these resources and success cases does \\nnot automatically translate into cross-industry ad option.  For the construction industry to adopt a \\nlearning organization culture the concept of continuous learning and personal advancement  must \\nbecome a fundamental operating concept within  organizations at every level and throughout \\nevery project and busin ess process.     \\nAdopting this concept requires the construction industry to fo cus on a long-term outlook for \\nlearning.  This paper introduced a new maturity model for organizations to follow while adopting \\nthis long-term outlook.  The development of a l earning organization cultur e requires investment \\nat all three learning entity levels  and in all five characteristics of the learning organization.  The \\norganizations that can objectively evaluate wher e they currently stand in the culture change \\nprocess and can strategically invest  in appropriate maturity levels , will be the ones that achieve \\nthis culture in a successful manner.
